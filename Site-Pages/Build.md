## Build
Right now while we are still working on developing the VeinCam this page is going to be a bit empty. When we have a better working prototype this page will be a guide on how to build a VeinCam and install the software (also available here) to run it.

If you are interested in [contributing](/Site-Pages/Contribute.md) then get in [contact](/Site-Pages/Contact.md) with us because we'd love to have any feedback and input you could provide. For more details you can also visit our [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/chrisbodger/VeinCam).
