# Decision Making Strategy
In order to make decisions that will have a significant effect on the project the team must come to a consensus decision. The following steps will be taken to strive for independant thought preceding each decision and ensure acceptance of the final decision:

1. Each member of the project team will be given the opportunity to state their perspective uninterrupted by the rest of the team.
2. If perspectives differ then a collaboration or compromise will be created so that the best possible decision can be made.
3. If the differences are not resolvable within the team then a majority 3-1 vote may be accepted to go accept a particular decision.
4. If the vote is split then the team will seek advice from stakeholders:
   * If the decision is design related the client will be contacted to have a final say on the decision.
   * If the decision is governance related then the shadow team will be contacted to provide insight and if necessary more votes (of which a majority of at least 7/10 will be accepted).
     * If an acceptable majority cannot be reached even with the shadow team then the tutor will be contacted for advice.
5. If after step 4 a decision still cannot be reached then the course convenor will be contacted as a last resort.

# Decision Log

| Date: | Stakeholders Involved | Decision Made: | Reason For Decision: | Effect on Project: |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2018-08-11 | Project Team | Commence New Development of Software | The HackADay code was not working as intended. The Networking segments of code where not applying, and as such we were not able to get a remote stream on a separate device. | Minimal. While some features could not be observed, it felt appropriate to move on and develop a more robust code to work with the device provided to us. The unobserved features (Brightness and Contrast controls) may still need to be considered, as they still affect the final product, and may slow development while the workings of these features be determined. |
| 2018-08-16 | Project Team | Manual Software Controls over Hardware Processing | Parameter editing required to be in place before they can be automatically adjusted | Will help understand how to create the automatic controls, as they should work by manual control firstly, before being handed over to software algorithms |
