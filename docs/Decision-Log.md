# Decision Making Strategy
In order to make decisions that will have a significant effect on the project the team must come to a consensus decision. The following steps will be taken to strive for independent thought preceding each decision and ensure acceptance of the final decision:

1. Each member of the project team will be given the opportunity to state their perspective uninterrupted by the rest of the team.
2. If perspectives differ then a collaboration or compromise will be created so that the best possible decision can be made.
3. If the differences are not resolvable within the team then a majority 3-1 vote may be accepted to go accept a particular decision.
4. If the vote is split then the team will seek advice from stakeholders:
   * If the decision is design related the client will be contacted to have a final say on the decision.
   * If the decision is governance related then the shadow team will be contacted to provide insight and if necessary more votes (of which a majority of at least 7/10 will be accepted).
     * If an acceptable majority cannot be reached even with the shadow team then the tutor will be contacted for advice.
5. If after step 4 a decision still cannot be reached then the course convenor will be contacted as a last resort.

# Decision Log

| Date: | Stakeholders Involved | Decision Made: | Reason For Decision: | Effect on Project: |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2018-08-11 | Project Team | Commence New Development of Software | The HackADay code was not working as intended. The Networking segments of code where not applying, and as such we were not able to get a remote stream on a separate device. | Minimal. While some features could not be observed, it felt appropriate to move on and develop a more robust code to work with the device provided to us. The unobserved features (Brightness and Contrast controls) may still need to be considered, as they still affect the final product, and may slow development while the workings of these features be determined. |
| 2018-08-16 | Project Team | Manual Software Controls over Hardware Processing | Parameter editing required to be in place before they can be automatically adjusted | Will help understand how to create the automatic controls, as they should work by manual control firstly, before being handed over to software algorithms |
| 2018-08-18 | Project Team and Client | Utilise the power switches on the PiJuice, and implement a low power state. | Turning off the device may become a secondary concern for users as other processes may take precedence, such as properly disposing of any sharps used, or an urgent matter is raised with another patient. This leaves the device continually running to drain the battery, becoming unusable until it has been recharged. Implementing a power off/sleep timer will be of a benefit during a busy period in the workplace. | There is a concern that the streaming script will not continue should it resume for a low power state. testing will need to be done to see if this idea is viable. Alternatively, ensuring that the device boots from no power within 10-15 seconds is suitable. The auto off function should still be implemented to turn the device off if it is not already. |
| 2018-08-22 | Hardware Team | Order bulk 850nm IR LEDs | The 850nm wavelength has been seen to be near optimal for vein detection, as it is absorbed by the hemoglobin in our blood, and reflected by our skin to create the contrast we need to identify veins. Given this is important, a large batch was ordered for testing and final implementations. Other wavelengths will be purchased to compare against and possibly augment the 850nm LEDs. | Using these LEDs will hopefully give the best image contrast. however, testing a mix of higher and lower wavelengths may allow for better performance, as it may result in a deeper penetration of light. |
| 2018-08-24 | Hardware Team | Optimise Case Design | The case printed successfully, however some issues were immediately apparent. The case itself was too big to hold comfortably, which does not align with the project requirements, as well as the simple mounting solution for the Pi was not ideal and easily came away from the case. The LED array does not have a mounting solution as of yet. V1.1 addresses the mounting solution for the Pi, as well as some little issues that could be addressed immediately. v2.0 has started to address the size issue, and potentially the LED mounting solution | Positive. This is an iterative process that has started early and allows us to bring any physical issues to light, allows us to rectify them, and optimise the solution. |
