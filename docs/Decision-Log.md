| 2018-08-11 | Commence New Development of Software | The HackADay code was not working as intended. The Networking segments of code where not applying, and as such we were not able to get a remote stream on a separate device. | Minimal. While some features could not be observed, it felt appropriate to move on and develop a more robust code to work with the device provided to us. The unobserved features (Brightness and Contrast controls) may still need to be considered, as they still affect the final product, and may slow development while the workings of these features be determined. |
