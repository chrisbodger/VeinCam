# Case Revisions

| Revision Number | Changes | Comments |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1.0 | Initial Design | Large and bulky, proof of concept |
| 1.1 | Adjusted the RPi mounting points, and the tolerances in the lid fit | Still large, but device sits relatively well. LED Array fits perfectly |
| 2.0 | Smaller, less gaps between RPi and wall, round internal edges, added array mounting lips to help hold larger PCBs | Charting port out of alignment, button holes were too close together |
| 2.1 | Button holes correctly spaced apart, aligned the charging port correctly | Print failed several times, seems to be overwritten by v2.2 |
| 2.2 | Adjustment to case, made more ergonomic, added compartment for magnetic mounts | Botton holes too low, slightly undersized |
| 2.3 | Raised the height of the buttons, made slightly larger | Concept, still needs to be printed and tested |
