# VeinCam
## Project Vision
The Project is based on the Venenfinder HackAThon project from 2017, to create an affordable and accessible device for superficial venous puncture, a requirement for patient blood testing or the delivery of external drug administration.

The device aims to assist medical professionals to successfully locate a viable vein for testing/delivery as they can be difficult to locate on some patients, as well as being cost effective that it can be built and used by patients with chronic diseases that regularly require drug administration at home.

The device should be portable, hands-free and wireless. Veins will be illuminated using near-Infrared light, and the scattering from this light detected by a Raspberry Pi device equipped with a PiCam module. Due to the variation in human skin in its absorption of different wavelengths of light, an unclear image can be produced, a proper candidate may be undetected. Having an auto-switch feature to automatically adjust the wavelength emitted is a priority. This adjusts the contrast of the image to allow for the easier detection of veins, with minimal input from the user.

## Deliverables
The project will hope to achieve a finalised prototype that meets a cost effective target of [AMOUNT] and can be easily assembled, and produce results equivalent to devices currently in use in hospitals that cost several magnitudes more than the VeinCam.

## Stakeholders
| Stakeholder | Effect On the Project |
| :---: | :--- |
| Project Team | Produces the Project Output and actions constructive feedback from other stakeholders |
| Shadow Team | Observes the Project and provides constructive feedback |

## Resources

## Risks
For the project and prototype to be successful it needs to be inexpensive and competitive in terms of results efficacy, these are more easily measured and validated requirements. A potential risk of the project is that the prototype is not simple enough to assemble and use and therefore would not find acceptance with the target users.

## Project Costs

## Project Timeline and Milestones

## Project Audits



• the key stakeholders, what do they do, and how they interact (dot points)
• identification of resources, risks, potential costs and who will bear them (tables)
– this includes an indicative financial budget (table)
• technical and other constraints (for example, reliability, security, safety)
• completion of Non-Disclosure Agreement and any Intellectual Property concerns (forms)
• the setup of tooling for development, management of tasks, and a link to the project repository (link)
• milestones for each Project Audit, including:
– a set of goals and deliverables for each audit (2-3 sentences)
– contingencies, such as stretch or crash goals for the milestone (2-3 sentences)
– a timeline for the project to reach the milestone (weekly table)
– a work breakdown structure for the milestone (as designed)

Assistive medical device to help localizing veins for intravenous access...

Medication that can’t be ingested through the gastrointestinal tract has to be injected intravenous - usually by a doctor but in chronic diseases it can also be carried out by yourself  ("home treatment", for example, venous puncture with medication 3 times per week).
Venous blood vessels used for medication are not always easy to recognize and if the needle is not secure in the vein, it must be punctured again at another point.  Here our project comes into play: Using NIR (near infrared) Illumination and real-time image processing, we can make the veins more visible!

We (my brother Elias, Lucie [a friend of mine] and me) submitted this project to Jugend Forscht. It will take part in the German Final in a week! Please keep your fingers crossed...
Our aim was to develop an assistive technology for venous puncture for diagnostic purposes (blood sampling) or for medical drug administration.
Easy reproduction and low costs are important criteria for development.

In addition to the research and review of specialist literature on methods of venous localization and optical characteristics of human skin, we carry out our own experiments. This Project contains the Python code needed for a mobile version that uses a smartphone or tablet as a display as well as the 3d-files needed to print it.
Please check the setup-file for a detailed description.
