# Project Vision
The Project is based on the Venenfinder project submitted during the 2017 HackADay event. The goal was to create an affordable device for superficial venous puncture, a procedure that is a requirement for patient blood testing and the delivery of external drug administration.

## Project Scope
The device aims to build on what was achieved in the Venenfinder project in assisting medical professionals to successfully locate a viable vein for testing/delivery, automating some functions while remaining cost effective so that the device can be built and used by patients with chronic diseases that regularly require drug administration at home.

The device should be portable, hands-free and wireless. Veins will be illuminated using near-Infrared light, and the scattering from this light detected by a Raspberry Pi device equipped with a PiCam module. 

Due to the variation in human skin in its absorption of different wavelengths of light, an unclear image can be produced, a proper candidate may be undetected. Having an auto-switch feature to automatically adjust the wavelength emitted will build on what has already been achieved. This adjusts the contrast of the image to allow for the easier detection of veins, with minimal to no input from the user.

## Project Team
The project team consists of four undergraduate engineers:
 * Christopher Bodger
 * Alexander Ollman
 * Stephanie Pratt
 * Joey McPhail

Ben Healey is our client for this project, currently an ANU Medical Student, and employee of ACT Health.

# Project Management
## Funding
The project brief informs us that we will need to take out a microgrant of around $100, with the client willing to fund us a further $300 should it be required. at most, the project should cost no more than the $400 proposed, but ideally, the project should cost less than this.

## Milestones
Milestones are yet to be determined. clear goals will be made after our meeting with our client.

## Timelines
Project timelines are yet to be determined, as with the milestones

## Tools
Several Tools will be used for this project, and they are listed below

### Project Administration
* GitHub
* GitHub Pages

### Manufacturing and Testing
* ANU Makerspace

# Deliverables
The project will hope to achieve a finalised prototype that meets a cost effective target of AU$300, can be easily assembled, and produce results equivalent to devices currently in use in hospitals that cost several magnitudes more than the VeinCam.

The aim of this project will be to achieve goals for each phase.

An example of the first phase may include:
- Construct Hackaday prototype with our materials.
- Create document outlining potential improvements to system.


# Stakeholders
The following groups have been identified as stakeholders for this project:
* Project Team - Produces the Project Output and actions constructive feedback from other stakeholders
* Shadow Team - Observes the Project and provides constructive feedback
* Course Tutor - Provides feedback on project progress
* Project Client - Provides feedback on project progress
* Course Convener - Provides feedback on project progress

# Resources
Source code from the Venenfinder HackAThon project has been utilised, as it achieves close to the client's desired deliverable.

# Risks
For the project and prototype to be successful it needs to be inexpensive and competitive in terms of results efficacy, these are more easily measured and validated requirements. A potential risk of the project is that the prototype is not simple enough to assemble and use and therefore would not find acceptance with the target users.
