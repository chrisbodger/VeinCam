## 1. Aims and purpose of this project
This project was started by the client who wished to develop an accessible and low-cost device that could be developed for the public for the purpose of enhanced vein visualisation using infra-red light - the VeinCam.
The client developed a preliminary prototype of the VeinCam based on the 2017 HackADAy Venenfinder project, and passed this prototype onto the project team to complete for their university course for further development of the device.
A full list of the project goals and stretch goals are in the [Concept of Operations document (ConOps)](/docs/CONOPS.md).

The project team is a group of four undergraduate ANU Engineeringg Students who completed a course which involved development of something as per the requirements and directions of the client. The course began in July 2018 and completed in November 2018.
A full list of the relevant stakeholders and their responsibilities at this stage of the project are
in the[ConOps](/docs/CONOPS.md).

The requirements developed by the project team and agreed upon by the client are listed in detail in the [Requirements](/docs/REQUIREMENTS.md)

outside the scope of the project (either from the beginning, or later on in the project).
These ideas were developed from the project team, with external advice and feedback from the client.
Testing that was completed by the client just prior to the end of the project is summarised in [this document](/Resources/Client-Feedback-VeinCam-Testing.md).
