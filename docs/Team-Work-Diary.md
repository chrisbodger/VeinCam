# ENGN4221 VeinCam Project Team Work Diary

Instruction: Team members to add progress of assigned tasks, including date of update and team member/s involved.


## Hardware and Software Activities

Progress from start of project as at 15/08/2018
* Assembled the hardware into the proposed configuration
* Installed and prepared the operating system as per the VeinCam Tutorial (Install OS, OpenCV and PaspAP softwares).
* Performed testing of the hardware with sample code provided by the Raspberry Pi documentation.

17/08/2018
* Alex researching into the implementation of manual software controls - intermediary step to automatic controls. Rudimentary control methods in place, yet to make them actionable.
* Chris designing an enclosure for the device and components using CAD software. Several concepts in mind, looking for a compact, ergonomic form factor.

18/08/2018
* Preliminary design of the case presented to the client. He was overall happy with the design as it stands. will continue to work on to add further features to accommodate the Pi device.

22/08/2018
* The first prototype (v1.0) case design ready to be printed. Chris will start the print in the makerspace overnight and will need to picked up the following day.

23/08/2018

**Hardware**
* Case v1.0 printed successfully, with a few minor defects. The simple supports for the Pi were easy to break, and most of the support material did not come away easily. Case v1.1 should be started today, hopefully to be picked up tomorrow for ANU Open Day. V1.1 brings stronger Pi supports, a more flush interface with the lid, enlarged openings for the IR LEDs, and a 180 degree reorientation when printing. this reorientation will generate more support material, but will hopefulle make for an easier clean up post print.
* The case shell was cleaned as best as possible and was determined to be too large for small hands. v2.0 has begun to address this, cutting the size down by almost 10mm all round. a proper mounting solution for the LED array will be embedded into the case lid as well, when the LED array has been constructed and finalised. further design improvementments to be implemented after our weekly meeting with the client.

**Software**
* Alex to fill out
