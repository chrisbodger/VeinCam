## September 25th
Several weeks have gone by since the last update, and theres much to talk about:

### Hardware
We are up to case version 2.2, that incorporates a smaller form factor and better ergonomics. Unfortunately these past few weeks have not been able to produce a successful print of the new case. We believe that this will be the final iteration of the case.

The only variation to the case that may happen is testing into a different LED configuration. the aim is to attempt to achieve a better contrast of skin and veins, and hope to achieve deeper skin penetration to visualise veins on people who have a higher BMI. This is still on going but we hope to have a clear idea by the end of this week.

### Software
The software currently works to automatically start up on boot up; initialising the wireless access point for external connections and starting the web stream to an external device. It has been noted that the wireless access point fails to start sometimes, making it difficult to connect to externally. This will be looked into as it is believed that there is other software that may be interfering with the hosting software and blocking it from starting.

Aside from this, some manual controls will be implemented to the hosting web page for better control over the software processing and image input.

### Governance and Bureaucratic Issues
Over the source of the mid semester teaching break the team was in contact with a variety of sources to discuss the purpose of the device and how that impacts the how we distribute information about the device. Through much discussion, the group decided the best path for the future of the project would be to advertise the device as an educational tool, assisting with teaching about veins and educating the public for informed consent of medical procedures.

Additionally, through correspondence with legal services and the ANU Human Ethics Committee, the group became aware that initial human testing of the device would not be able to be completed at this stage of the project as human ethics approval is necessary to do testing. This provides some roadblocks for the development of the device as the group is not able to determine how the device needs to be improved for optimal practical use. As such, the aims and scope of the project were modified slightly.

Going forward, the group will be finishing up with tutorial documents on how to build the device, documents for conducting future testing, and acting on feedback from the client on the functioning of the device. The group is also developing designs for the poster to present the device at the closure of this project.
