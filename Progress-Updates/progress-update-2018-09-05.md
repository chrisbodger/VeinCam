## September 5th
Progress this week has been based around finalising the prototype. This has taken longer than anticipated due to a few setbacks with 3D printing and finalising code.

### Hardware
Version 2.0 of the chassis has proved difficult to complete as there has been complications with the 3D printers. A version was printed however the mounting pins inside the case were malformed. An ad hoc mechanism may be used with the print and if the issue persists then an alternative will be chosen. Version 2.1 will be printed tomorrow with the hope that it will be suitable to hand to the client for preliminary testing.

### Software
A successful stream has been created with the automatic contrast adjustment. The next step is to get the Pi to run the necessary scripts on boot so that the process can be simple and automated when users turn on the device.

The goal is to complete a working prototype in both hardware and software to give to the client this Saturday (8th of September)
