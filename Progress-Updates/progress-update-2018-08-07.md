August 7th
After a successful [meeting](#Meeting-Minutes/Meeting-Minutes-2018-08-04.md) with the client, we are confident that we have a clear direction on how the project will proceed. The client agreed that our initial [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) was sensible and mutually agreed that the milestones set out within the document are achievable. The missing fields within the ConOps will need to be filled in this week, as per our goals set out within the [August 1st](Meeting-Minutes/Meeting-Minutes-2018-08-01.md) team meeting.

#### Hardware Update
The supplied hardware has been prepared with an operating system and prerequisite software, opening the way for further testing in regards to the HackADay software. Commencement of this task will be this week in efforts to achieve our first milestone.

While a definitive contrast for vein detection may not be possible without some manual hardware that will not be used (The potentiometers from the Venenfinder), we hope that something may be detected using what we currently have. This will save an unnecessary expense as these components are planned to be replaced by automatic tuning algorithms.
