### Software

Implimented buttons into the HTML video streaming page, which trigger Flask/Python functions to set the camera parameters of brightness, contrast and saturation for the next frame. These buttons were designed to be large and use appropriate colours (red for lower, green for higher) in order to be intuative and intended for an educational audience. Following a meeting with the client after the testing, the stream is now shown in portrait rather than landscape to take advantage of the fact most users will be streaming to their personal devices in a portrait orientation, as well as being able to view someone's arm verticaly along the webpage.

All code had been uploaded into the software folder, including a complete image file which can be written to an SD card and used immediately with a Raspberry Pi and a PiCam (a method which has been tested and validated!). If the user does not have a PiJuice shield, minor adjustments must be made to app.py (see README.md in software folder or /home/pi/pistream in image for details).

#### A chronological work diary of software development throughout this project has also been added to the software folder.

### Audit 3 Presentation

The VeinCam was presented at our final Audit presentation during our tutorial timeslot. The final version was demonstrated to shadows and tutor. A draft of the poster to be presented next week was shown for feedback. The feedback given on the physical design, product functionality and overall presentation was very positive.
