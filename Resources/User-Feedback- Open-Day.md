# User Feedback


## Preliminary Feedback - ANU Open Day 25/8/18
A variety of users were able to test the very preliminary working model of the Vein Cam

Some unqiue user cases were tested, the results are summarised below. 

| Unique Features: | Vein Visualisation Results and Issues: |
| :---: | :---: |
| Medium dark hair  | Cleal visualisation of veins  |
| Medium body fat/veins not at the surface | Difficult to see veins in forearms |
| Medium dark skin, small body body fat/veins not at surface  | Difficult to see veins in forearm  |
| Small child (<10 yrs) | Good response, clear visualisation of veins |
| Dark skin | Clear visualisation of veins at the surface |

Note: many pale skinned, young and healthy users were tested with excellent visualisation results.

The overall public response to the idea of a vein visualisation camera was excellent despite the rough nature of the preliminary working protoype. Many people were aware of the need for such a product, but not currently aware of any available. There were no issues raised with the use of the device, and some expressed interest at following the project further.
