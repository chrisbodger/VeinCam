## How are Medical Devices regulated in Australia
* Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a division of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing is responsible for administering the Act/legislation
* The Office of Devices Authorisation (ODA) is the area within the TGA responsible for pre-market regulation of medical devices
* Office of Product Review (OPR) responsible for post-market regulation of all therapeutic goods
-	The TGA may conduct assessments before a device is to be supplied to mark, and while it is available on the market
-	Regulatory requirements vary depending on the device. The level of assessment performed by the TGA before the device is supplied in Australia directly related to the level of potential risk

Main elements of regulation

-	Product requirements – Essential Principles – for the quality, safety and performance of  the medical device and options as to how compliance with essential principles can be demonstrated, and optional use of recognised standards
-	A device classification scheme based on different levels of risk
-	Ongoing monitoring of medical devices that are available on the market
-	The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as the central point of control for the legal supply of medical devices in Australia
-	Provisions for imposing penalties where regulatory requirements are breached
-	A range of corrective actions that may be taken if there is a problem with a device

Legislation makes provisions for specific types of devices including
-	Single use
-	Active (energy using)
-	Systems or procedure packs
-	Custom made medical devices

Majority of medical devices must be included in the ARTG before being made available for supply in Australia. For this, the TGA must be satisfied that evidence exists appropriate to the perceived risks of the device to support its safe and effective use, and that an appropriate system is in place for monitoring the ongoing performance and safety of the device. An application to include the device in the ARTG even if the device is the same as one already included in the ARTG.

## Life-Cycle Approach to the Regulation of a medical device
1.	Concept- consider the essential principles
2.	Prototype – incorporate the essential principles into the design
3.	Preclinical – Seek approval from or notify the TGA of intention to commence clinical trial
4.	Clinical – follow clinical trial guidelines, prepare clinical devaluation of clinical data
5.	Manufacturing – apply conformity assessment procedures and then obtain appropriate conformity assessment evidence
6.	Marketing – adhere to the therapeutic goods advertising code
7.	Supply – apply to include device in ARTG, monitor safety and performance of device during lifetime, maintain conformity assessment evidence, report any problems with the device to the TGA and to the users of the device, recall and/or correct devices that have defects, design flaws, or unacceptable clinical risks or levels of performance.
8.	Obsolescence – notify the TGA so the device can be removed from the ARTG
