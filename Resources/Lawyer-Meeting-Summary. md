# Lawyer Meeting Summary

Meeting on 11/9/18 Dr Michael Curtotti - General Counsel and Lawye
Summary of takeaways:
*	Upon reviewing Therapeutic Goods Administration documentation on medical device classification the VeinCam device is classified as a medical device
*	Since we have already publicly stated the purpose of the device, that leaves us open to some issues if we decide to re-purpose the device
* Upon reviewing the Therapeutic Goods administration documentation, the team is a manufacturer if we are supplying the device (or how to make it) and we put ourselves at risk if we decided to make that information public without undergoing the legislated conformity processes
*	The email to the TGA is a good idea – no harm in detailing about this device and the issues we are facing (although may want to make the page private first?) 
*	Consulting the technology transfer office is probably a good idea – they deal a lot with getting university projects out into the real world. May be able to provide details on how to seek seed funding if we want to go down that path
*	Giving the device to Ben for testing without undergoing human ethics clearance is probably a risky move. This is a university has policies on the responsible conduct of research that should be followed in this situation since we are doing testing on people.

*	The team has been considering these issues external to the project but they are a part of the project
*	Should consider making the page -or parts of the page - private and not undergo anymore human testing if we want to be fully protected going into the future
*	It might be that the next(?) iteration of this project can focus more on these issues (testing, conformity/commercialisation, etc)
