Section 1 - Site Selection and Insertion of PIVC

## Equipment
-	Dressing trolley
-	IV starter pack plus alcohol swabs, or basic dressing pack plus alcohol swabs and occlusive transparent film dressing.
-	Infusion device (safety cannula)
-	Needle-less connection valve, safesite or caresite or Extension set with needle-less connection valve or safevalve
-	Syringe 5ml
-	Drawing up needle
-	Sodium chloride (flushing)
-	IV giving set (if required)
-	Infusion pump or syringe driver (if required)
-	Tourniquet
-	Tape for securement of giving set
-	Clean gloves or sterile gloves
-	Safety goggles or protective face shield
-	Underpad (bluey)
-	Local anaesthetic if required
-	Alcohol based hand rub


## Procedure 
1.	Ensure PIVC required
2.	Consider central venous access, to avoid peripheral vein damage if necessary
3.	Ensure PIVC is equipped with safety engineered device with sharps injury protection. 
4.	The size of the PIVC should be determined by the intended use, the condition of the patient’s veins, likely length of time PIVC is expected to remain in situ and the insertion site.
5.	The PIVC should be the shortest and smallest gauge that can meet the anticipated clinical need to ensure optimal flow. 
6.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
7.	Explain the procedure to the patient and obtain informed verbal consent
8.	Conduct positive patient identification procedure 
9.	Check the patient’s history for bleeding disorders, medications and allergies, including whether the patient has allergies to skin antiseptics or dressing materials.
10.	Check for previous difficulties with cannulation and/or IV therapy.
11.	Ensure privacy.
12.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
13.	Set up, prepare, assemble and open equipment.
14.	Don protective eyewear.
15.	Position patient comfortably, supporting proposed area of insertion. Place the underpad as required.
16.	Apply tourniquet, select vein then release tourniquet.
17.	Select the most appropriate vein for insertion of the PIVC. Points to consider include: 
a.	Patient’s activity level
b.	Size and condition of patient’s veins
c.	Indication for PIVC and expected duration of PIVC
d.	Position of patient during any planned procedure(s)
e.	Use non-dominant forearm if practical
f.	Use basilic or cephalic veins on the posterior (dorsal) forearm if possible (below)
g.	The metacarpal veins on the dorsum of the hand (below) are easier to visualise but are more liable to clot, difficult to stabilise, and prone to vessel damage
h.	In patients with chronic renal failure, the use of the anterior (ventral) forearm veins (especially the cephalic vein) should be avoided, as these may be required for fistula formation for dialysis.

Avoid the use of veins in the following sites:

•	Areas of flexion or bony prominences
o	Vein easily damaged
o	Uncomfortable
•	Areas below previous cannulation site
o	Vein may be damaged
•	Bruised or phlebitis (inflamed veins) areas
o	Poor venous return
o	Piece of clot can be dislodged into the system
•	A limb with an arteriovenous fisulae (abnormal connection between an artery and a vein)  or shunt (hole or a small passage which moves, or allows movement of, fluid from one part of the body to another)
o	May compromise the haemodialysis access
•	An arm on the same side as a previous lymph node dissection, mastectomy or affected by cerebrovascular accident
o	Poor venous/lymphatic return
•	An infected limb (e.g. cellulitis)
•	A limb with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or implanted venous access device
•	Lower limbs (infants excepted)
o	Risk of deep vein thrombosis
o	Limits access, patient comfort and mobility

 Procedure cont:
 
18.	Prepare venepuncture site as required e.g. remove hair at the insertion site. Clean site if necessary.
19.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
20.	Don gloves, sterile or non sterile according to skill level.
21.	Place sterile towel under the selected area.
22.	Clean insertion site and surrounding area using alcohol swabs or such. Apply antiseptic to cover 5x5cm area, allow skin to air dry (30s).
23.	Reapply tourniquet, using sterile gauze or with use of an assistant.
24.	If required, inject local anaesthetic intra dermally (between the layers of the skin), beside the elected IV site creating a small bleb on the skin. Do not puncture vein when anaesthetising the skin. 
25.	Insert cannula ensuring vein is punctured (visualising ‘flashback’ at the hub of the cannula).
26.	Advance plastic cannula and withdraw the stylet. If the PIVC fails to enter vein, start over with new PIVC if sterility has been breached. 
27.	Release tourniquet, attach needleless injection cap or extension set with needleless injection cap to the hub of the cannula and flush cannula with 0.9% NaCl to confirm placement.
28.	Secure the IV cannula with Steristrip.
29.	Clearly record the date and time of insertion of the PIVC on the tape or occlusive transparent dressing.
30.	Insertion site should remain visible at all times.
31.	As soon as possible after the insertion of the PIVC, document the date, time, site and size of the cannula in the patient’s clinical records and nursing care plan. 
32.	A maximum of two attempts at PIVC insertion is permitted; following two failed attempts, consult a more experienced clinician. If a more experienced clinician has made two attempts, the clinician is to decide whether they continue attempting to insert the PIVC, or whether an alternate IV access should be considered.

# Venous Access in Neonatal Intensive Care
## Equipment required 
•	IV trolley
•	Dressing pack
•	Skin cleansing solution
•	24 gauge IV cannula
•	Luer lock T piece
•	Occlusive dressing
•	Adhesive strapping and arm-board
•	Ampoule of heparinised saline 50 unit in 5mL
•	3 way tap 
•	5mL syringe
•	500 Units Heparin in 500mL 0.45% Saline
•	Intravenous giving set
•	Transducer set and cable
•	Cold light
•	Sucrose
•	1mL syringe

## Procedure
Radial and posterior tibial arteries are the preferred site for arterial cannulation. 
Before cannulation, the Allen test should be used to assess for collateral circulation.
Document any arterial sites that have been cannulated attempted in the clinical record.

1.	Prime giving set and transducer
2.	Administer 0.25mL sucrose/expressed breastmilk (EBM) orally  +/- pacifier 2 minutes prior to procedure for pain relief
3.	Prime the T piece with heparinised saline
4.	Cleanse the skin 
5.	Using the transilluminator, transilluminate the dorsal aspect of the wrist to find the  artery
6.	Insert the cannula at a 45 degree angle
7.	Remove stylet – pull the cannula back until blood is seen. This signifies that the arterial lumen has been entered
8.	Attach the primed extension set and primed syringe and flush the cannula 
9.	Secure the cannula with occlusive dressings
10.	Place the arm board in the correct position ensuring the cannula and extension set is well stabilised
11.	Tape into position ensuring the area above the insertion site is visible
12.	Attach the primed giving set and transducer
13.	Commence the infusion according to the fluid maintenance orders (usually 1mL/hr)
14.	Position the transducer at heart level, plug into pressure monitor and calibrate transducer 
15.	Record on the transducer the date it is due to be changed – every 4 days
16.	Observe the infusion site for patency of the artery 
17.	Observe for pink, warm and well perfused digits and/or limbs distal to the cannulation 
18.	Document on the arterial line observation chart hourly
19.	Document on the observation chart and baby’s notes when and where the arterial line was inserted 
20.	If circulatory compromise occurs inform Registrar - remove line quickly.
21.	Apply warmth to opposite limb if peripheries blanched
22.	Ensure blood pressure alarm limits are set and activated (includes systolic/diastolic and mean)
23.	Calibrate and zero pressure line once per shift and after sampling
24.	Record hourly systolic/diastolic and mean blood pressure
25.	Position baby according to developmental care protocol
26.	Clean and dispose of equipment according to OH&S guidelines
