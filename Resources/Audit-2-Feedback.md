# Audit 2 Feedback and Action Summary

A summary of the recommendations to improve regarding different aspects of the project.

| Area of interest | Recommendation | Actions Taken  | Justification |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Hardware  | Alternative construction methods other than 3D printing | Research begun on alternative methods | Not main focus due to changed goals of the project  |
| | Wireless charging considered | Not yet discussed | |
| | Integrating buttons and charging ports | Integrated into the new model | |
| |  |  | |
| Software  | Make software easier to follow for users | Will be integrated coming up to the end of the project | Not for the public as future makers of the device as per the changed direction of the project but for future project  |
| |  |  | |
| Goals  | Improve clarity of stretch goals that are the focus of the project | Working on clearly stating the goals of the project | Primary goals of the project have been changed so this will be integrated into new goals |
| |  |  | |
| Testing  | Ensure automatic contrast and depth works in all conditions | Will be integrating this into the team testing | Can no longer test in hospital or with a wide variety of use cases  |
| | Clear validation and real-world testing techniques available to all stakeholders | Currently writing up detailed user testing | Will be partially used by team testing but also will be for future project |
| |  |  | |
| Decision Making | Add more decisions into decision log - e.g. why desings are changed | | |
| | Document why certain things in the project are taking priority - e.g. what research is being done and outcomes hoping to be achieved | Will work this in as a brief summary | |
| |  |  | |
| Teamwork and Communication | Administrative work not being distributed evenly  | No action | The team is functioning well as is  |
| | Rotate roles so that some team members can expand their learning  | Up for discussion, will start to integrate this in small doses so it doesn't impede the momemtum of the project |  |
| | Appears from meeting minutes that workload is not distributed evenly | Team needs to keep Issues on the Git and actionables in meeting minutes up to date | Team members need to be aware of their tasks as well as other stakeholders aware of what's going on |
| |  |  | |
| Documentation | Ensure documentation up to date | Making this a priority coming up to the end of the project | Could be passing on the project - important that our progress is traceable |
| | Landing page doesn't help navigate repository very well | No action | Client naviagates repository easily, landing page is only for basic information |
| | Progress update should explicitly state how the project is progressing against each milestone | Already does this to some extend. With the changes goals and milestones will be making this more clear in the future | Less focus on public aspect of the project from now on |
| | Gaps in the repository that have been present for a while | Will update these in the next week | |
| |  |  | |
| Reflection and Feedback  | Seek experts externally to add more value to the decisions made and outside opinions | Consulted a variety of external stakeholders regarding bureaucratic issues over the holidays - lawyer, human ethics committee, technology transfer office. Will work on integrating hardware/software feedback from external sources  | Needed to focus on bureaucratic issues over holidays, now focus on hardware/software  |
| | Collate and display feedback and responses - even informal feedback from client - more clearly in a structured document | Feedback form currently under construction. Will be documenting feedback better now prototype is nearly fully functional | Haven't had too much feedback previously |
| | Plan real world testing of the device with operators external to your team | Cannot do this due to bureaucratic issues currently, will work on securing this for possible future project | Require human ethics clearance for human testing |
