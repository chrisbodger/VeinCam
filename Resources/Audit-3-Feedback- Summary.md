# Audit 3 Feedback and Action Summary


A summary of the recommendations to improve regarding different aspects of the project.

| Area of interest | Raw Feedback from reviewers (project team, shadows, client, tutor) | Recommendation | Actions Taken  | Justification |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Documentation Updates | “...it did take a little longer than anticipated to successfully migrate our repository and device specifications to an educational format (nearly 3 weeks). We definitely could have completed this sooner, as clear and correct documentation is critical in any project, and ours is no exception.”  | Aim to update documentation as soon as actions occur so as not to get behind. | Write up final feedback responses before close of project. Recommendation included in SECTION of handover document. | Coming to the end of the project, not much time to act on this feedback. Future teams will benefit by knowing this should be made a priority. |
| Hardware  | “While there were some difficulties with printing the case, and creating manual controls for the soware, the client was overall happy with what was presented. I would have liked to have it to them sooner, if it weren’t for the 3D printing attempts resulting in unsuccessful prints. Help could have been sought sooner, and errors in the print rectified.” “There were a few stumbles between the beginning of the break and a fortnight ago, which meant opportunity for feedback on the working device occurred quite late in the project. Ideally, a cut point would have occurred a few weeks earlier whereby whatever minimally-viable-product was available would be tested. Doing so might have helped guide decisions around the trade-o between eort directed toward case design vs software functionality, which in hindsight was probably a little out of balance.” | Get prototypes to client sooner to receive better feedback. Make alternate plan early in the project if one subsystem may hold up progress significantly. | Recommendation included in SECTION of handover document | This recommendation will be helpful for the planning stage of the next project. |
| Communication with external stakeholders and experts  | “External advice is something the hardware team could have taken on board more often, and is something that occurs quite regularly in the real workplace, as is the role for consulting engineers.” “For the future I think external stakeholders could be involved more in decisions regarding the hardware and software development. This could help the group be better educated about the issues they are facing and therefore improve their decisions.” “If any deliberate seeking of mentoring happened this would also be good to demonstrate. Similarly if any external benchmarking was put into place this would be good to demonstrate.” | Plan early in the project on avenues for each subsystem to seek external advice and benchmarking. Reach out for advice throughout project to help prototype iteration.  | Some external advice has been pursued earlier in the project. Recommendation included in SECTION of handover document.  | This recommendation will be helpful for the planning and prototyping in the next project. |
| Setting short term milestones | “Our outputs were not always linear and stagnated a bit after Audit 2 and our weekly goals and deliverables following later meetings became less clear.” “The last few weeks could have been more defined. The milestones we outlined were clear, however they were not broken down into a week-by-week format, so that we could clearly say what we had achieved aer each meeting, either with the tutorial group, or with the client. We were constantly working towards some major milestone, and I believe that had become a hindrance, as we initially made great progress early on, but slowed down towards the end of the project. Breaking down the milestones further may have prevented this.” “Our weekly output deliverables could have been more thoroughly defined aer each meeting rather than “continue to work towards large goal, as this would have resulted in each member regularly updating the repository.”  | Weekly milestones were not clearly documented for the second half of the project, causing progress to stagnate. | Recommendation included in SECTION of handover document.  | This recommendation is very helpful however most outputs are now being wrapped up. Future projects would benefit in ensuring that milestones are clearly planned out right through to the end of the project. |
| Testing of the device and feedback  | “More testing of the device with the manual controls would have been really useful in having usage information of exactly how the device needs to be used/setup for each individual user, and in theory we could have improved the hardware, software and documentation based on that.” “The lack of testing meant that our final VeinCam product is based on a lot of predispositions and assumptions regarding soware settings and LED brightness, and that we were unable to tweak the parameters (camera/LED brightness, contrast etc) to be best optimised for general use.” “It was disappointing to see that the team could not do any testing, as this would have assisted the team in making further decisions on what changes need to be made to the device. As such the decisions made on which elements of the device to focus on improving could not be completely justified.” | Testing would have been very beneficial to improving the final prototype, and provide more direction about software and hardware improvements at the end of the project. |  Issues with testing due to ethics approval will be made clear in the handover document  | There was not enough time to pursue ethics approval to complete testing by the time the team found out about ethics approval. Future project teams will be able to pursue this early on in the project to reduce setbacks that were experienced this semester.  |
| Rotating project team roles | “Planning from the start to find time to involve members across different tasks would have been beneficial to the project as well as help everyone develop more skills and approach problems from at least a slightly different perspective. Trying to do this late in would have been very difficult but it something to think about in future.” “For future it would be good to see more team members getting involved in different roles so that they can increase their skill set even more and get more value out of the project.” “It would have been great to see team members be more active in developing skills outside of their typical discipline but overall you should be very proud.” “In terms of improvement, it seems like the four of you are stuck in your own roles (which is good, as you are all now experts in your role), however it would be nice to see some collaboration for hardware, or software, or research and secretarial duties, so that you all get the most out of this project.” | Involve team members in different aspects of the project to gain a better skill base and experience.  | Recommendation will be included in SECTION of the handover document.  | It is too late in the project to implement this feedback. Ideally, this should be planned for at the beginning of the project so that time is explicitly made to handover tasks between different team members. Future project teams will benefit by knowing this should be thought about sooner rather than later in the project.  |
| Software - UI controls  | “The only thing that would change about the current set up is the UI for the camera picture. I think having the controls below the picture makes it difficult to control the picture, as if the person wants to adjust the image they have to scroll down, change it, then scroll up. This means that they have to cycle up and down to perfect the image. Moving the buttons to the side of the image might be a better idea as they can see the immediate result of their change and adjust accordingly without having to scroll up and down.”  | Change user interface of VeinCam so that controls are beside the picture rather than below. | Recommendation will be noted in SECTION of the handover document. | Future project teams will benefit from having this feedback, and will be able to conduct testing about which layout of buttons is more practical. |
| Decision Making clarity | “At times, decisions made on Messenger or even after meetings weren’t recorded in the decision log or acted upon. This hindered our progress at times, and was noted in feedback provided during Audit 2 but not acted upon….. I feel like this occurred a few times with each member throughout our project for both the governance and the final product output, and had we kept a closer eye on these decisions we would have had a clearer tracking of our decision making” “It is clear in your audits that your decisions are evidence based however your landing page and repository are not consistent with this. The only reason I say that is because it will be important if you hand the project over to a new team next Semester. It is clear you have reached out to Ben for advice and input in decision making which is fantastic however I would also encourage you to align some of your decisions with some sort of professional standards.” “In places I believe your decision making could have been documented more thoroughly. For example your progress updates discuss not changing the LED configuration because performance was not improved. It would have been better if you had detailed what tests were completed and images that demonstrate the differences.”  | Ensure all discussion with team members, client and external stakeholders and decisions made are documented thoroughly. | Decision log will be updated to the best of our ability before the end of the project. This recommendation will be included in SECTION of the handover document.  | Some decisions will not be able to be recalled at this late stage of the project but the team will try their best.  The team also only started the decision log late, so good habits surrounding this were not developed. Future teams would benefits by knowing the decision log should be updated with detail regularly and from the beginning of the project.  |
| Software Documentation  | “One key thing I would like to point out is the lack of updates regarding software development. The code and the development diary were only uploaded this Tuesday evening. Although shadows can get a rough sense of how software development is going on in the Progress Updates section and the meeting minutes, it may be hard to verify where the team is exactly at and give useful feedback without seeing the real code or a development diary with regular commits...The software development document uploaded on Tuesday summarises the whole development process. However, I would suggest using a table to list all problems encountered and their solutions. This can greatly help future team to troubleshoot. In general going through a table is much easier than reading through the whole document”  |  Coding was not updated very often, making it hard to track. Make a summary table at the top of the software develop document for ease of navigation. | The software lead will develop a brief table at the top of the software development document before the close of the project. |  This late in the project, regular commits to the software code is not necessary as minimal changes are made. A table is a good idea for future projects. |
| Documenting Feedback  | “Regarding communication with client (Ben Healy), from meeting minutes I cannot see any client input except he agreed with switching the device to educational purpose. I would suggest client input shall be clearly listed and traceable.” “Feedback is present in the repository however it might be better suited to the docs section and regardless of that could have its own folder for clarity. I think the response table is a great idea and shows responses and justification against feedback. However including the raw feedback gained from the audits would show transparency so that anyone reading can see if anything was missed moving from raw feedback to the summaries present in the table. Conversely there is raw feedback from clients and preliminary user feedback, but no direct response. Even though this information may have been taken on board it would be good to explicitly show this” “The team has a feedback summary for audit 2, and it includes the feedback received and actions taken by the team. Some action items are not traceable. For instance, the team stated they would collate all feedback but so far I failed to see any documents that summaries client and shadow feedback received by the team except this audit 2 feedback document … One other thing Id like to point out is the team fails to include clients feedback regarding the lack of updates on software side of the project to the audit 2 feedback summary. This feedback is clearly stated on the last page of audit 2 feedback document. It seems the team overlooked this feedback as the code and development diary were only uploaded on Tuesday night.” “Similarly, documentation was fairly stagnant for an extended period, which made it diicult to follow progress and ensure the team was following up on audit feedback. From a client’s perspective, one benefit from having more regular documentation updates would have been the opportunity to give “outsider” feedback on how the provision of final public information might generally look.”  | Formal client feedback should be formally documented. Raw feedback included in the response table would be better for transparency.  Ensure responses to feedback and actions are well traceable and acted upon.  | Feedback in the repository will reviewed and actionable items will be closed before the end of the project. The handover document will include actions that have not been achieved. | Clarity of feedback can be slightly improved coming into the end of the project, however it will be difficult to give detail where no feedback was before. Acting on making it easier to find feedback will be the best use of time coming into the end of the project.   |
| Improvements to the VeinCam tutorial  | “Regarding the VeinCam Tutorial document, since the device will be used for educational purposes, I would suggest the team to consult high school teachers or science communication professionals on how to write instructions for students of certain age.” “ Not sure what to say in terms of improvement - to reach really high, perhaps consider getting advice and feedback from schools and teachers and build them into your stakeholder network.” “I have a number of suggestions to make it easier to follow. Firstly USE SPELL CHECK. This goes for the whole repository. Minor typos and spelling mistakes are a distraction.You need to make some formatting changes to make the tutorial easier to follow. Numbering the steps or stages might help users to keep track of their position. The proper use of figure captions and labels including referring to images within the text by the figure number leads to less misinterpretation. Image size is also an issue, for example the LED array image is far too small. Also consider where you should add diagrams as well as photos. Do you have a diagram of how everything physically fits together or photos?” | Consultation of external advice to improve VeinCam tutorial document.  Tutorial document should be reviewed for errors, use numbered steps, figure captions and labels, and use of photos.  | Some changes to the tutorial document will be made before the close of the project. This recommendation will be included in SECTION of the handover document. | Not enough time left to complete all aspects of this feedback but will be beneficial for future teams to provide most value to the client.  |
| Repository formatting | “Another thing I would suggest is to establish a file root directory to clearly show where each document is located.” " Firstly USE SPELL CHECK. This goes for the whole repository. Minor typos and spelling mistakes are a distraction."  | Establish a file root directory to help navigate the repository. Review repository for spelling and grammatical errors. | | |
| Project Outputs | “The other one is related to alternative casing construction without using 3D printer. This item can be traced to the decision log however it is not reflected to any output. The decision log states there will be a cardboard template however I fail to see this when I am writing this review.” | Cardboard template has not been uploaded to the repository. | This will aim to be uploaded before the close of the project. In absence of this, a recommendation to complete this will be included in the handover document.  | Completion of this task may be difficult to do with many other elements of the project to be wrapped up.  |
| Visualisation - Poster  | “The poster is still in development however, I would like to see some colour alterations, a lighter background, and darker venous system might produce a bolder statement, and align with the output from our device (darker veins contrasting with the skin). The colouring for some of the text boxes feels conflicting and could be quite confusing. Creating a colouring scheme that helps guide the viewer through the features of the device and other information could be more beneficial in helping convey information more clearly.” “Ensure that the colours make sense and display the connections you want people to see. Having things like the problem scope and outcomes more explicitly stated might develop a better understanding of the project. There is a fair amount of space that could be used for content or making the current content larger and more visible.... However even if there is not anything to add the current content could be made larger and easier to see. The colours can seem a bit random so sectioning these better might help direct the viewer where you want them to make the connections. Similarly the contribute section might be better on the right with future development in the middle in terms of narrative. However this would be difficult to maintain the visuals of the boxes, maybe remedied by adding an image to the future development section. The scope is kind of implicit in the scenario-problem-resolution section however having it be explicit might be more impactful and ease understanding of the viewer. There also doesn't seem to be any direct results of testing, which is indicative that none was able to be completed, however an outcomes section could be used to demonstrate explicitly what was achieved.” “The only real issue that I see with the poster is that it it doesn’t really direct the viewer anywhere but to the picture. So aer looking at the picture, I don’t really know where my eyes are meant to go next.” | Colouring should be reviewed for clarity. Explicitly state problem scope and outcomes. Space could be used for more content or making content larger. Add an image to the future development section. Outcomes section could be used to explicitly state what was achieved in place of formal testing.  Flow of poster could be improved. | The poster has been submitted already.  | Some feedback was already acted upon from the audit feedback. Hopefully this was sufficient to improve the poster for the showcase.   |
| Testing documentation | “It is well understood why you have not completed human testing but the testing you did complete has not been documented in great detail. It might have been useful for future teams if you could explain the method you used to test various features and the results of these changes. For example providing examples of the image achieved with various LED configurations. This would havetold more of the story of how you product developed to its current state and these test details could be of use forfuture testing." | | |
