# Client Feedback User Testing 

Client was able to have the device for several days and suggested changes or aspects of future development.
These are summarised below, with actions on each item.
Positives:
  * Startup process is simple and easy to use
  * Case easy to hold
  * Used several times on battery power
  * Able to see valves in veins ("hot spots") and found some veins that couldn't be seen manually

Things to Work On:
  * Intermittently took several attempts to get wifi working - include element for improvement in handover document
  * Stand would help with usability - unable to implement magnets in this case iteration due to thickness of printing. 
  Will include suggestions on how to improve case design to include magnets in case design for mounting in handover document.
  * Battery indicator would help identify when charging needed -  Battery percentage indicator now included in user interface
  * Issues with finding ideal distance away from arm to achieve optimum viewing of veins - Will be noted in the handover document
  that this was an issue to be included in elements of future user testing.
  * Make it able to have orientation rotated - Working on this for the final showcase
  * Test under different conditions - Will be included in handover document for user testing
