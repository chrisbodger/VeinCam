1.	The manufacturer of a medical device is the person who is responsible for the design, production, packaging and labelling of the device before it is supplied under the person’s name, whether or not it is the person, or another person acting on the person’s behalf, who carries out those operations. 
2.	If subsection (1) does not apply to a medical device, the manufacturer of the device is the person who, with a view to supplying the device under the person’s name, does one or more of the following using ready made products: 

  a.  assembles the device; 
  
  b.  packages the device; 
  
  c.	processes the device; 
  
  d.	fully refurbishes the device; 
  
  e.	labels the device; 
  
  f.	assigns to the device its purpose by means of information supplied, by the person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
  
     i.	the labelling on the device; 
     
     ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
     
     iii.	any advertising material relating to the device; 
     
     iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of the device. 

3.	However, a person is not the manufacturer of a medical device if: 
  a.	the person assembles or adapts the device for an individual patient; and 
  b.	the device has already been supplied by another person; and 
  c.	the assembly or adaptation does not change the purpose intended for the device by means of information supplied by that other person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
    i.	the labelling on the device; 
    ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
    iii.	any advertising material relating to the device. 
    iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of action of the device 

Manufacturer’s responsibilities
-	Determine classification, intended purpose, appropriate GMDN code
-	Select and apply appropriate conformity assessment procedures to demonstrate compliance with the essential principles
-	Ensure that they have appropriate processes in place and documentation to demonstrate this before they apply to the TGA or an EU Notified Body for conformity assessment evidence
-	Obtain the conformity assessment and ensure the information on the certificate remains current and valid
-	Pay the application and assessment fees for obtaining the conformity assessment evidence
-	Prepare an Australian Declaration of Conformity that includes all the manufacturing details for the medical device
-	Ensure that their conformity assessment procedures are appropriately maintained once they obtain the necessary conformity assessment evidence, and that the ongoing requirements are met
-	Notify the TGA of substantial changes to the design, production or intended performance of the device

Sponsor of a medical device

The sponsor is the person or company responsible for the importation of medical devices into Australia, and/or the supply of medical devices in Australia, and/or the export of medical devices from Australia, as well as making application to the TGA to have their device included in the ARTG.

### Manufacturer Definition
"  “Manufacturer” means any natural or legal person  with responsibility for design and/or manufacture of a medical device with the intention of making the medical device available for use, under his name; whether or not such a medical device is designed and/or manufactured by that person himself or on his behalf by another person(s). "

Responsibility for:
1.  This ‘natural or legal person’ has ultimate legal responsibility for ensuring compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements for the medical device in the countries or jurisdictions where it is intended to be made available or sold, unless this responsibility is specifically imposed on another person by the Regulatory Authority (RA) within that jurisdiction.
2.  The manufacturer’s responsibilities are described in other GHTF guidance documents.  These responsibilities include meeting both pre-market requirements and post-market requirements, such as adverse event reporting and notification of corrective actions.
3.  ‘Design and/or manufacture’, as referred to in the above definition, may include specification development, production, fabrication, assembly, processing, packaging, repackaging, labelling, relabelling, sterilization, installation, or remanufacturing of a medical device; or putting a collection of devices, and possibly other products, together for a medical purpose.
4.  Any person who assembles or adapts a medical device that has already been supplied by another person for an individual patient, in accordance with the instructions for use, is not the manufacturer, provided the assembly or adaptation does not change the intended use of the medical device.
5.  Any person who changes the intended use of, or modifies, a medical device without acting on behalf of the original manufacturer and who makes it available for use under his own name, should be considered the manufacturer of the modified medical device.
6.  An authorised representative, distributor or importer who only adds its own address and contact details to the medical device or the packaging, without covering or changing the existing labelling, is not considered a manufacturer.
7.  To the extent that an accessory is subject to the regulatory requirements of a medical device , the person responsible for the design and/or manufacture of that accessory is considered to be a manufacturer.

## Placing a Medical Device on the Market

( as per EU Regulations )

"Placing on the market" means "the first making available in return for payment or free of charge of a device other than a device intended for clinical investigation, with a view to distribution and/or use on the Community market, regardless of whether it is neew or fully refurbished."
When software qualifies as a medical device, the software is then effectively brough to market when first made available - irrespective of whether a fee was charged or not.

## Refurbishment of  medical device
https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/F2018C00490
1.  A refurbishment of a medical device is taken to have occurred if the medical device, or a part of the device, is substantially rebuilt from one or more used medical devices of that kind so as to create a medical device that is able to be used for the purpose originally intended by the manufacturer of the original device.
2.  Without regulating subregulation (1 - above), a refurbishment of a medical device may involve the following actions:
a.  Stripping the device into component parts of sub-assemblies;
b.  Checking parts of the device for suitability for reuse;
c.  Replacing component parts of sub-assemblies of the device that are not suitable for reuse;
d.  Assembling reclaimed or replacement component parts of sub-assemblies of the device or another used device
e.  Testing a reassembled device against the specifications of the original device, or, if the manufacturer has revised those specifications, the revised specifications
f.  Identifying an assembled device as a refurbished device.
