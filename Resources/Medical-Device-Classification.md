# Medical Device Classification

## What is a Medical Device

-	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance materials or other article (whether used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its proper application) intended, by the person under whose name it is or it to be supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the following:
  - Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;
  - Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or disability;
  - Investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;
  - Control of conception;
  - And that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be assisted in its function by such means; or
    - Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article specified under subsection (2A); or
    - Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or any other article that is included in a class of instruments, apparatus, appliances,  materials or other articles specified under subsection (2B); or
    -  An accessary to such an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article covered by paragraph (all above).
-	Medical devices
  o	Are used for humans
  o	Have therapeutic benefits
  o	Generally have a physical or mechanical effect on the body or are used to measure or monitor functions of the body

## Classification Rule and Class

If the device is active – that is, the device depends on a source of energy for its operation and convers energy – then apply Classification rule 4 (classifications vary depending on intended purpose). This includes diagnostic x-ray source, MRO, patient monitors, etc.
Classification Rule 4 – Active Medical Devices.
Active medical device is defined as being a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer:
-	To depend on its operation on a source of electrical energy or other source of energy (other than a source of energy generated directly by a human being or gravity)
-	To act by converting this energy; but
-	Does not include a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to transmit energy, a substance, or any other element between an active medical device and a human being without any significant change in the energy, substance or other element being transmitted. (example EEG leads, tubing sets).
Some examples of active medical devices; pacemakers, electric hospital beds, software, x-ray machines, surgical lasers, ultrasound machines. 

Rule 4.2 or 4.3 depends on whether the device is intended for therapeutic use (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures for the purpose of treating or alleviating an illness, injury or disability) or diagnosis (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to supply information for the purpose of detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological conditions, states of health, illness or congenital deformities.)

Assuming this device comes under diagnostic – this rule covers devices that are used in ultrasound diagnosis and capture of physiological signals and devices used in diagnostic radiology. 
Rule 4.3 – Active Medical device for diagnosis. If used to monitor vital processes where variations could result in immediate danger – then class 11b, otherwise 11a
-	Rule 4.3(2)(a): A device to supply energy that will be absorbed by a patient’s body (except a device that illuminates the patient’s body in the visible spectrum)—Class IIa 
E.g. magnetic resonance equipment, pulp testers, evoked response stimulators, diagnostic ultrasound 
-	4.3(2)(c) A device used for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes of a patient, excluding devices mentioned in the previous entry—Class IIa. 
E.g. electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs, cardioscopes with or without pacing pulse indicators, electronic thermometers. 
Hence this device should come under medical device class 11a.
Accuvein Device Classification
-	Has an ARTG Certificate, classified under Class 11a


## Radio-communication Transmitters

Devices with radio-communication transmitters and/or that connect to telecommunications networks 
-	Medical devices intended for connection to Australian telecommunication networks or that use Australian radio communication spectrum are required to be compatible with these systems (see Essential Principle 9.1). 
-	In Australia, medical devices that connect to a public telecommunications network must comply with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) A-Tick requirements. Medical devices with radio communication transmitters (for example, Bluetooth devices) must comply with the ACMA spectrum licensing and C-Tick requirements. Further details are available in Section 13. Active medical devices. 
-	The EU radio spectrum and telecommunications requirements (for example, Radio & Telecommunications Terminal Equipment(R&TTE) Directive 1999/5/EC) are different to those in Australia.

## Sterilisation of medical devices

-	Some medical devices required to be sterile when used to minimise the risk of infection – should be “terminally sterilised to a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of at leave 10^-6, unless this is not possible due to material incompatibility with the proposed sterilisation process”
-	Common sterilisation methods;
o	Moist heat or steam
o	Dry heat
o	Ionising radiation
o	Ethylene oxide (gas)
o	Liquid chemical sterilisations (e.g. alcohol)

## Essential Principles
For a medical device to be supplied in Australia, it must be demonstrated that relevant Essential Principles have been met. This is usually by implementing systems that meet internationally recognised standards.
General principles:
1.	Use of medical devices do not compromise health and safety
2.	Design and construction of medical devices to conform with safety principles
3.	Medical devices to be suitable for intended purpose
4.	Long-term safety 
5.	Medical devices not to be adversely affected by transport or storage
6.	Benefits of medical devices to outweigh any undesirable effects
Principles about design and construction
7.	Chemical, physical and biological properties (choice of materials appropriate, minimisation of risks associated with contaminants and residues, ability to be used safely with materials, verification of incorporated substance, leaching substances)
8.	Infection and microbial contamination (minimisation of infection and contamination, control of tissues and cells etc)
9.	Construction and environmental properties (devices used in combination with other devices or equipment, minimisation of risks associated with use of medical devices)
10.	Medical devices with a measuring function 
11.	Protection against radiation (protection, intended or otherwise)
12.	Medical devices connected to or equipped with an energy source
13.	Information to be provided with medical devices
14.	Clinical evidence
15.	Principles applying to IVD medical devices only 

## Electromedical safety standards
A device that is powered by electricity – mains, battery and low-powered devices – are electromedical devices.
Manufacturers of these devices must demonstrate compliance with:
-	Essential Principle 9.2: Minimisation of risks associated with the use of medical devices
-	Essential principle 12 – medical devices connected to or equipped with an energy source
Best way to demonstrate compliance is to meet a standard published by an international standards agency. E.g. AS/NZ 3200.1.0: Medical electrical equipment – general requirements for safety. These standards are published in book form which in 195 pages, $223.31 for the PDF, or $496.25 for the hardcopy book.
