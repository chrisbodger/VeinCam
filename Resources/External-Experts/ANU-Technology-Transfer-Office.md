# ANU Technology Transfer Office Meeting Summary

Meeting on 18/09/2018 at the Technology Transfer Offices - 121 Marcus Clarke Street, Level 6.

Attended by:
* Stephanie Pratt
* Christopher Bodger
* Representative from the Technology Transfer Office (TTO rep)

The purpose of the meeting with the TTO was to gain another opinion about whether or not the device for this project was a medical
device and to gain some advice about possible steps the project team or client could take to commercialise the device. 

The ANU technology transfer is a service provided by the university to help students commercialise research and other ideas so
they may be realised outside of university. The TTO rep noted several times that they did not have extensive background on 
open source projects, and only had limited experience with medical devices and legislation. 

The TTO rep considered the VeinCam device not to be a medical device based on some assumptions regarding other devices that
could be considered for medical use but likely do not undergo the level of scrutiny needed for a medical device. (note, this
advice was later found to be incorrect after discussion with the Therapeutic Goods Administration). They also noted that 
a medical device registration number was required to market a device and they considered that unless a device is has a number
then it is not a medical device (again, this was later found to be incorrect). 
The TTO rep talked about the difficulty in commercialising a medical device in Australia, given the length of the process and the
extensive monetary resources required to complete the process. They also said that if we wished to go down that path, 
we would be best to start researching similar devices, their patents, and see if they have had to undergo medical device regulation
conformity, and what process they went about that.
This was not widely considered to be a viable option by the team, so it was not thought to be beneficial to document this process
further.
