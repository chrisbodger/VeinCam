# ANU Human Ethics Committee Correspondence

Summary of the information received from email correspondence with the ANU Human ethics committtee (HEC).

## Summary of First email - From Project team to HEC
* summary of the purpose of this course
* summary of the main objectives of the team and the client
* summary of what the team is making for this course including pictures of the device and images it produces
* summary of the main feedback elements the team wishes to obtain from user testing (in a hospital)
* request if the team requires human ethics clearance before commencing testing

## Summary of first response from HEC to project team
* The project definitely needs ethics clearance
* Researching in a hospital setting can provide additional stress to patients
* Testing in a hospital rpobably needs ACT Health HREC approval since an ACT health site would be involved
* If a researcher was found to be conducting reseach in a hospital without such approval it would cause many issues
* Suggest applying for human ethics clearance 

## Second email sent fron project team to HEC
* Enquiry if approval is still required if testing not done in a hospital, just on the general population
* For instance, on university students

## Second email response from HEC to project team
* Any testing on human subjects requires ethics approval if it is affiliated with the ANU
