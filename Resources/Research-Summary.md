# Research Summaries

Some preliminary research has been done for supplementary information regarding the medical device product market.

## Regulatation of Medical Devices
### How are Medical Devices regulated in Australia
 * Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a division of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing is responsible for administering the Act/legislation
 * The Office of Devices Authorisation (ODA) is the area within the TGA responsible for pre-market regulation of medical devices
 * Office of Product Review (OPR) responsible for post-market regulation of all therapeutic goods
-	The TGA may conduct assessments before a device is to be supplied to mark, and while it is available on the market
-	Regulatory requirements vary depending on the device. The level of assessment performed by the TGA before the device is supplied in Australia directly related to the level of potential risk

Main elements of regulation

-	Product requirements – Essential Principles – for the quality, safety and performance of  the medical device and options as to how compliance with essential principles can be demonstrated, and optional use of recognised standards
-	A device classification scheme based on different levels of risk
-	Ongoing monitoring of medical devices that are available on the market
-	The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as the central point of control for the legal supply of medical devices in Australia
-	Provisions for imposing penalties where regulatory requirements are breached
-	A range of corrective actions that may be taken if there is a problem with a device

Legislation makes provisions for specific types of devices including
-	Single use
-	Active (energy using)
-	Systems or procedure packs
-	Custom made medical devices

Majority of medical devices must be included in the ARTG before being made available for supply in Australia. For this, the TGA must be satisfied that evidence exists appropriate to the perceived risks of the device to support its safe and effective use, and that an appropriate system is in place for monitoring the ongoing performance and safety of the device. An application to include the device in the ARTG even if the device is the same as one already included in the ARTG.

### Life-Cycle Approach to the Regulation of a medical device
1.	Concept- consider the essential principles
2.	Prototype – incorporate the essential principles into the design
3.	Preclinical – Seek approval from or notify the TGA of intention to commence clinical trial
4.	Clinical – follow clinical trial guidelines, prepare clinical devaluation of clinical data
5.	Manufacturing – apply conformity assessment procedures and then obtain appropriate conformity assessment evidence
6.	Marketing – adhere to the therapeutic goods advertising code
7.	Supply – apply to include device in ARTG, monitor safety and performance of device during lifetime, maintain conformity assessment evidence, report any problems with the device to the TGA and to the users of the device, recall and/or correct devices that have defects, design flaws, or unacceptable clinical risks or levels of performance.
8.	Obsolescence – notify the TGA so the device can be removed from the ARTG

### Manufacturer of a medical Device

1.	The manufacturer of a medical device is the person who is responsible for the design, production, packaging and labelling of the device before it is supplied under the person’s name, whether or not it is the person, or another person acting on the person’s behalf, who carries out those operations. 
2.	If subsection (1) does not apply to a medical device, the manufacturer of the device is the person who, with a view to supplying the device under the person’s name, does one or more of the following using ready made products: 
a.	assembles the device; 
b.	packages the device; 
c.	processes the device; 
d.	fully refurbishes the device; 
e.	labels the device; 
f.	assigns to the device its purpose by means of information supplied, by the person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
i.	the labelling on the device; 
ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
iii.	any advertising material relating to the device; 
iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of the device. 

3.	However, a person is not the manufacturer of a medical device if: 
a.	the person assembles or adapts the device for an individual patient; and 
b.	the device has already been supplied by another person; and 
c.	the assembly or adaptation does not change the purpose intended for the device by means of information supplied by that other person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
i.	the labelling on the device; 
ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
iii.	any advertising material relating to the device. 
iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of action of the device 

Manufacturer’s responsibilities
-	Determine classification, intended purpose, appropriate GMDN code
-	Select and apply appropriate conformity assessment procedures to demonstrate compliance with the essential principles
-	Ensure that they have appropriate processes in place and documentation to demonstrate this before they apply to the TGA or an EU Notified Body for conformity assessment evidence
-	Obtain the conformity assessment and ensure the information on the certificate remains current and valid
-	Pay the application and assessment fees for obtaining the conformity assessment evidence
-	Prepare an Australian Declaration of Conformity that includes all the manufacturing details for the medical device
-	Ensure that their conformity assessment procedures are appropriately maintained once they obtain the necessary conformity assessment evidence, and that the ongoing requirements are met
-	Notify the TGA of substantial changes to the design, production or intended performance of the device

Sponsor of a medical device

The sponsor is the person or company responsible for the importation of medical devices into Australia, and/or the supply of medical devices in Australia, and/or the export of medical devices from Australia, as well as making application to the TGA to have their device included in the ARTG.

## Fees and Charges for Medical Devices

This section will be written based on the assumption of a Class 11a medical device.

### Annual Charges
-	Not applicable for low-turnover products
-	Low turnover: turnover is estimated to be no more than 15 times the annual charge for inclusion in the ARTG for a financial year

## Medical Device Classification

### What is a Medical Device

-	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance materials or other article (whether used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its proper application) intended, by te person under whose name it is or it to be supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the following:
o	Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;
o	Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or disability;
o	Investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;
o	Control of conception;
o	And that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be assisted in its function by such means; or
	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article specified under subsection (2A); or
	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or any other article that is included in a class of instruments, apparatus, appliances,  materials or other articles specified under subsection (2B); or
	An accessary to such an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article covered by paragraph (all above).
-	Medical devices
o	Are used for humans
o	Have therapeutic benefits
o	Generally have a physical or mechanical effect on the body or are used to measure or monitor functions of the body

### Classification Rule and Class

If the device is active – that is, the device depends on a source of energy for its operation and convers energy – then apply Classification rule 4 (classifications vary depending on intended purpose). This includes diagnostic x-ray source, MRO, patient monitors, etc.
Classification Rule 4 – Active Medical Devices.
Active medical device is defined as being a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer:
-	To depend on its operation on a source of electrical energy or other source of energy (other than a source of energy generated directly by a human being or gravity)
-	To act by converting this energy; but
-	Does not include a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to transmit energy, a substance, or any other element between an active medical device and a human being without any significant change in the energy, substance or other element being transmitted. (example EEG leads, tubing sets).
Some examples of active medical devices; pacemakers, electric hospital beds, software, x-ray machines, surgical lasers, ultrasound machines. 

Rule 4.2 or 4.3 depends on whether the device is intended for therapeutic use (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures for the purpose of treating or alleviating an illness, injury or disability) or diagnosis (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to supply information for the purpose of detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological conditions, states of health, illness or congenital deformities.)

Assuming this device comes under diagnostic – this rule covers devices that are used in ultrasound diagnosis and capture of physiological signals and devices used in diagnostic radiology. 
Rule 4.3 – Active Medical device for diagnosis. If used to monitor vital processes where variations could result in immediate danger – then class 11b, otherwise 11a
-	Rule 4.3(2)(a): A device to supply energy that will be absorbed by a patient’s body (except a device that illuminates the patient’s body in the visible spectrum)—Class IIa 
E.g. magnetic resonance equipment, pulp testers, evoked response stimulators, diagnostic ultrasound 
-	4.3(2)(c) A device used for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes of a patient, excluding devices mentioned in the previous entry—Class IIa. 
E.g. electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs, cardioscopes with or without pacing pulse indicators, electronic thermometers. 
Hence this device should come under medical device class 11a.
Accuvein Device Classification
-	Has an ARTG Certificate, classified under Class 11a


### Radio-communication Transmitters

Devices with radio-communication transmitters and/or that connect to telecommunications networks 
-	Medical devices intended for connection to Australian telecommunication networks or that use Australian radio communication spectrum are required to be compatible with these systems (see Essential Principle 9.1). 
-	In Australia, medical devices that connect to a public telecommunications network must comply with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) A-Tick requirements. Medical devices with radio communication transmitters (for example, Bluetooth devices) must comply with the ACMA spectrum licensing and C-Tick requirements. Further details are available in Section 13. Active medical devices. 
-	The EU radio spectrum and telecommunications requirements (for example, Radio & Telecommunications Terminal Equipment(R&TTE) Directive 1999/5/EC) are different to those in Australia.

### Sterilisation of medical devices

-	Some medical devices required to be sterile when used to minimise the risk of infection – should be “terminally sterilised to a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of at leave 10^-6, unless this is not possible due to material incompatibility with the proposed sterilisation process”
-	Common sterilisation methods;
o	Moist heat or steam
o	Dry heat
o	Ionising radiation
o	Ethylene oxide (gas)
o	Liquid chemical sterilisations (e.g. alcohol)

## Essential Principles
For a medical device to be supplied in Australia, it must be demonstrated that relevant Essential Principles have been met. This is usually by implementing systems that meet internationally recognised standards.
General principles:
1.	Use of medical devices do not compromise health and safety
2.	Design and construction of medical devices to conform with safety principles
3.	Medical devices to be suitable for intended purpose
4.	Long-term safety 
5.	Medical devices not to be adversely affected by transport or storage
6.	Benefits of medical devices to outweigh any undesirable effects
Principles about design and construction
7.	Chemical, physical and biological properties (choice of materials appropriate, minimisation of risks associated with contaminants and residues, ability to be used safely with materials, verification of incorporated substance, leaching substances)
8.	Infection and microbial contamination (minimisation of infection and contamination, control of tissues and cells etc)
9.	Construction and environmental properties (devices used in combination with other devices or equipment, minimisation of risks associated with use of medical devices)
10.	Medical devices with a measuring function 
11.	Protection against radiation (protection, intended or otherwise)
12.	Medical devices connected to or equipped with an energy source
13.	Information to be provided with medical devices
14.	Clinical evidence
15.	Principles applying to IVD medical devices only 

### Electromedical safety standards
A device that is powered by electricity – mains, battery and low-powered devices – are electromedical devices.
Manufacturers of these devices must demonstrate compliance with:
-	Essential Principle 9.2: Minimisation of risks associated with the use of medical devices
-	Essential principle 12 – medical devices connected to or equipped with an energy source
Best way to demonstrate compliance is to meet a standard published by an international standards agency. E.g. AS/NZ 3200.1.0: Medical electrical equipment – general requirements for safety. These standards are published in book form which in 195 pages, $223.31 for the PDF, or $496.25 for the hardcopy book.

o	Competency assessment: flushing of PIVCs and administration of contrast media
PIVC insertion may only be performed by staff that have completed appropriate IV cannulation training and credentialing.
Section 1 - Site Selection and Insertion of PIVC

### Equipment
-	Dressing trolley
-	IV starter pack plus alcohol swabs, or basic dressing pack plus alcohol swabs and occlusive transparent film dressing.
-	Infusion device (safety cannula)
-	Needle-less connection valve, safesite or caresite or Extension set with needle-less connection valve or safevalve

-	Tape for securement of giving set
-	Clean gloves or sterile gloves
-	Safety goggles or protective face shield
-	Underpad (bluey)
-	Local anaesthetic if required
-	Alcohol based hand rub


### Procedure 
1.	Ensure PIVC required
2.	Consider central venous access, to avoid peripheral vein damage if necessary
3.	Ensure PIVC is equipped with safety engineered device with sharps injury protection. 
4.	The size of the PIVC should be determined by the intended use, the condition of the patient’s veins, likely length of time PIVC is expected to remain in situ and the insertion site.
5.	The PIVC should be the shortest and smallest gauge that can meet the anticipated clinical need to ensure optimal flow. 
6.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
7.	Explain the procedure to the patient and obtain informed verbal consent
8.	Conduct positive patient identification procedure 
9.	Check the patient’s history for bleeding disorders, medications and allergies, including whether the patient has allergies to skin antiseptics or dressing materials.
10.	Check for previous difficulties with cannulation and/or IV therapy.
11.	Ensure privacy.
12.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
13.	Set up, prepare, assemble and open equipment.
14.	Don protective eyewear.
15.	Position patient comfortably, supporting proposed area of insertion. Place the underpad as required.
16.	Apply tourniquet, select vein then release tourniquet.
17.	Select the most appropriate vein for insertion of the PIVC. Points to consider include: 
a.	Patient’s activity level
b.	Size and condition of patient’s veins
c.	Indication for PIVC and expected duration of PIVC
d.	Position of patient during any planned procedure(s)
e.	Use non-dominant forearm if practical
f.	Use basilic or cephalic veins on the posterior (dorsal) forearm if possible (below)
g.	The metacarpal veins on the dorsum of the hand (below) are easier to visualise but are more liable to clot, difficult to stabilise, and prone to vessel damage
h.	In patients with chronic renal failure, the use of the anterior (ventral) forearm veins (especially the cephalic vein) should be avoided, as these may be required for fistula formation for dialysis.

Avoid the use of veins in the following sites:

•	Areas of flexion or bony prominences
o	Vein easily damaged
o	Uncomfortable
•	Areas below previous cannulation site
o	Vein may be damaged
•	Bruised or phlebitis (inflamed veins) areas
o	Poor venous return
o	Piece of clot can be dislodged into the system
•	A limb with an arteriovenous fisulae (abnormal connection between an artery and a vein)  or shunt (hole or a small passage which moves, or allows movement of, fluid from one part of the body to another)
o	May compromise the haemodialysis access
•	An arm on the same side as a previous lymph node dissection, mastectomy or affected by cerebrovascular accident
o	Poor venous/lymphatic return
•	An infected limb (e.g. cellulitis)
•	A limb with a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) or implanted venous access device
•	Lower limbs (infants excepted)
o	Risk of deep vein thrombosis
o	Limits access, patient comfort and mobility

 Procedure cont:
 
18.	Prepare venepuncture site as required e.g. remove hair at the insertion site. Clean site if necessary.
19.	Wash hands or apply ABHR.
20.	Don gloves, sterile or non sterile according to skill level.
21.	Place sterile towel under the selected area.
22.	Clean insertion site and surrounding area using alcohol swabs or such. Apply antiseptic to cover 5x5cm area, allow skin to air dry (30s).
23.	Reapply tourniquet, using sterile gauze or with use of an assistant.
24.	If required, inject local anaesthetic intra dermally (between the layers of the skin), beside the elected IV site creating a small bleb on the skin. Do not puncture vein when anaesthetising the skin. 
25.	Insert cannula ensuring vein is punctured (visualising ‘flashback’ at the hub of the cannula).
26.	Advance plastic cannula and withdraw the stylet. If the PIVC fails to enter vein, start over with new PIVC if sterility has been breached. 
27.	Release tourniquet, attach needleless injection cap or extension set with needleless injection cap to the hub of the cannula and flush cannula with 0.9% NaCl to confirm placement.
28.	Secure the IV cannula with Steristrip.
29.	Clearly record the date and time of insertion of the PIVC on the tape or occlusive transparent dressing.
30.	Insertion site should remain visible at all times.
31.	As soon as possible after the insertion of the PIVC, document the date, time, site and size of the cannula in the patient’s clinical records and nursing care plan. 
32.	A maximum of two attempts at PIVC insertion is permitted; following two failed attempts, consult a more experienced clinician. If a more experienced clinician has made two attempts, the clinician is to decide whether they continue attempting to insert the PIVC, or whether an alternate IV access should be considered.
