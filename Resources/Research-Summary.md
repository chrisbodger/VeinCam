# Research Summaries

Some preliminary research has been done for supplementary information regarding the medical device product market.

## Regulatation of Medical Devices
### How are Medical Devices regulated in Australia
 * Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), a division of the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing is responsible for administering the Act/legislation
 * The Office of Devices Authorisation (ODA) is the area within the TGA responsible for pre-market regulation of medical devices
 * Office of Product Review (OPR) responsible for post-market regulation of all therapeutic goods
-	The TGA may conduct assessments before a device is to be supplied to mark, and while it is available on the market
-	Regulatory requirements vary depending on the device. The level of assessment performed by the TGA before the device is supplied in Australia directly related to the level of potential risk
Main elements of regulation
-	Product requirements – Essential Principles – for the quality, safety and performance of  the medical device and options as to how compliance with essential principles can be demonstrated, and optional use of recognised standards
-	A device classification scheme based on different levels of risk
-	Ongoing monitoring of medical devices that are available on the market
-	The Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) as the central point of control for the legal supply of medical devices in Australia
-	Provisions for imposing penalties where regulatory requirements are breached
-	A range of corrective actions that may be taken if there is a problem with a device
Legislation makes provisions for specific types of devices including
-	Single use
-	Active (energy using)
-	Systems or procedure packs
-	Custom made medical devices
Majority of medical devices must be included in the ARTG before being made available for supply in Australia. For this, the TGA must be satisfied that evidence exists appropriate to the perceived risks of the device to support its safe and effective use, and that an appropriate system is in place for monitoring the ongoing performance and safety of the device. An application to include the device in the ARTG even if the device is the same as one already included in the ARTG.
Life-Cycle Approach to the Regulation of a medical device
1.	Concept- consider the essential principles
2.	Prototype – incorporate the essential principles into the design
3.	Preclinical – Seek approval from or notify the TGA of intention to commence clinical trial
4.	Clinical – follow clinical trial guidelines, prepare clinical devaluation of clinical data
5.	Manufacturing – apply conformity assessment procedures and then obtain appropriate conformity assessment evidence
6.	Marketing – adhere to the therapeutic goods advertising code
7.	Supply – apply to include device in ARTG, monitor safety and performance of device during lifetime, maintain conformity assessment evidence, report any problems with the device to the TGA and to the users of the device, recall and/or correct devices that have defects, design flaws, or unacceptable clinical risks or levels of performance.
8.	Obsolescence – notify the TGA so the device can be removed from the ARTG

Manufacturer of a medical Device

1.	The manufacturer of a medical device is the person who is responsible for the design, production, packaging and labelling of the device before it is supplied under the person’s name, whether or not it is the person, or another person acting on the person’s behalf, who carries out those operations. 
2.	If subsection (1) does not apply to a medical device, the manufacturer of the device is the person who, with a view to supplying the device under the person’s name, does one or more of the following using ready made products: 
a.	assembles the device; 
b.	packages the device; 
c.	processes the device; 
d.	fully refurbishes the device; 
e.	labels the device; 
f.	assigns to the device its purpose by means of information supplied, by the person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
i.	the labelling on the device; 
ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
iii.	any advertising material relating to the device; 
iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of the device. 

3.	However, a person is not the manufacturer of a medical device if: 
a.	the person assembles or adapts the device for an individual patient; and 
b.	the device has already been supplied by another person; and 
c.	the assembly or adaptation does not change the purpose intended for the device by means of information supplied by that other person, on or in any one or more of the following: 
i.	the labelling on the device; 
ii.	the instructions for using the device; 
iii.	any advertising material relating to the device. 
iv.	technical documentation describing the mechanism of action of the device 

Manufacturer’s responsibilities
-	Determine classification, intended purpose, appropriate GMDN code
-	Select and apply appropriate conformity assessment procedures to demonstrate compliance with the essential principles
-	Ensure that they have appropriate processes in place and documentation to demonstrate this before they apply to the TGA or an EU Notified Body for conformity assessment evidence
-	Obtain the conformity assessment and ensure the information on the certificate remains current and valid
-	Pay the application and assessment fees for obtaining the conformity assessment evidence
-	Prepare an Australian Declaration of Conformity that includes all the manufacturing details for the medical device
-	Ensure that their conformity assessment procedures are appropriately maintained once they obtain the necessary conformity assessment evidence, and that the ongoing requirements are met
-	Notify the TGA of substantial changes to the design, production or intended performance of the device

Sponsor of a medical device
The sponsor is the person or company responsible for the importation of medical devices into Australia, and/or the supply of medical devices in Australia, and/or the export of medical devices from Australia, as well as making application to the TGA to have their device included in the ARTG.

Fees and Charges for Medical Devices
This section will be written based on the assumption of a Class 11a medical device
Annual Charges

Syringes and tubing for infusion pumps – Rule 2.2(1)(c) and 2.2(1)(a) Class I
Wounds strips and gauze dressing etc. come under Rule 2.4(3)   Class I
Hypodermic needles and syringes – Rule 3.2(2) surgically invasive devices intended for transient use. Class IIa
Medical Device Classification
What is a Medical Device
-	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance materials or other article (whether used alone or in combination, and including the software necessary for its proper application) intended, by te person under whose name it is or it to be supplied, to be used for human beings for the purpose of one or more of the following:
o	Diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of disease;
o	Diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or disability;
o	Investigation, replacement or modification of the anatomy or of a physiological process;
o	Control of conception;
o	And that does not achieve its principal intended action in or on the human body by pharmacological, immunological or metabolic means, but that may be assisted in its function by such means; or
	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article specified under subsection (2A); or
	Any instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or any other article that is included in a class of instruments, apparatus, appliances,  materials or other articles specified under subsection (2B); or
	An accessary to such an instrument, apparatus, appliance, material or other article covered by paragraph (all above).
-	Medical devices
o	Are used for humans
o	Have therapeutic benefits
o	Generally have a physical or mechanical effect on the body or are used to measure or monitor functions of the body
Classification Rule and Class
If the device is active – that is, the device depends on a source of energy for its operation and convers energy – then apply Classification rule 4 (classifications vary depending on intended purpose). This includes diagnostic x-ray source, MRO, patient monitors, etc.
Classification Rule 4 – Active Medical Devices.
Active medical device is defined as being a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer:
-	To depend on its operation on a source of electrical energy or other source of energy (other than a source of energy generated directly by a human being or gravity)
-	To act by converting this energy; but
-	Does not include a medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to transmit energy, a substance, or any other element between an active medical device and a human being without any significant change in the energy, substance or other element being transmitted. (example EEG leads, tubing sets).
Some examples of active medical devices; pacemakers, electric hospital beds, software, x-ray machines, surgical lasers, ultrasound machines. 
Rule 4.2 or 4.3 depends on whether the device is intended for therapeutic use (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to support, modify, replace or restore biological functions or structures for the purpose of treating or alleviating an illness, injury or disability) or diagnosis (an active medical device that is intended by the manufacturer to be used on a human being, either alone or in combination with another medical device, to supply information for the purpose of detecting, diagnosing, monitoring or treating physiological conditions, states of health, illness or congenital deformities.)
Assuming this device comes under diagnostic – this rule covers devices that are used in ultrasound diagnosis and capture of physiological signals and devices used in diagnostic radiology. 
Rule 4.3 – Active Medical device for diagnosis. If used to monitor vital processes where variations could result in immediate danger – then class 11b, otherwise 11a
-	Rule 4.3(2)(a): A device to supply energy that will be absorbed by a patient’s body (except a device that illuminates the patient’s body in the visible spectrum)—Class IIa 
E.g. magnetic resonance equipment, pulp testers, evoked response stimulators, diagnostic ultrasound 
-	4.3(2)(c) A device used for direct diagnosis or monitoring of vital physiological processes of a patient, excluding devices mentioned in the previous entry—Class IIa. 
E.g. electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs, cardioscopes with or without pacing pulse indicators, electronic thermometers. 
Hence this device should come under medical device class 11a.
Accuvein Device Classification
-	Has an ARTG Certificate, classified under Class 11a


Radio-communication Transmitters
Devices with radio-communication transmitters and/or that connect to telecommunications networks 
-	Medical devices intended for connection to Australian telecommunication networks or that use Australian radio communication spectrum are required to be compatible with these systems (see Essential Principle 9.1). 
-	In Australia, medical devices that connect to a public telecommunications network must comply with the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) A-Tick requirements. Medical devices with radio communication transmitters (for example, Bluetooth devices) must comply with the ACMA spectrum licensing and C-Tick requirements. Further details are available in Section 13. Active medical devices. 
-	The EU radio spectrum and telecommunications requirements (for example, Radio & Telecommunications Terminal Equipment(R&TTE) Directive 1999/5/EC) are different to those in Australia.

Sterilisation of medical devices
-	Some medical devices required to be sterile when used to minimise the risk of infection – should be “terminally sterilised to a Sterility Assurance Level (SAL) of at leave 10^-6, unless this is not possible due to material incompatibility with the proposed sterilisation process”
-	Common sterilisation methods;
o	Moist heat or steam
o	Dry heat
o	Ionising radiation
o	Ethylene oxide (gas)
o	Liquid chemical sterilisations (e.g. alcohol)
