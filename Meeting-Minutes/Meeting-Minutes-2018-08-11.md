### Project team only - ConOps to work on
* Stakeholder analysis and requirements to add (Steph done in documents, not sure how best to put up on the Git)
* add contact emails to project team section
* theres some typos in the Risk Analysis

## Progress Update
* Start new code as the venenfinder is outdated/messy.

## Deliverables
* Remove manual adjustment of brightness.
  * Automate that process in hardware to get image off the bat.
    * Then use that to go through software adjustments.
* PiZero is probably not realistic, last priority.
* What are we adding to the venenfinder
  * Automatic controls.
  * Making it portable/mobile and wireless.
  * Form factor.
    * Reduce the amount of LEDs.
* Think about how the case is going to attach to the stand even if the stand isn't done in the project.

## Requirements
* Integrated screen could complicate and be less useful.
  * More components for the battery.
  * Having a screen next to the arm could be more helpful for keeping an eye on both.
* Boot time down to 10s or less ideally.
* Battery to last at least a couple of hours.
  * OK for prototype to not last that long.
  * Could be improved with a better battery.

* Don't let the costs of medical device administration get in the way of project work.
  * Just need to show we've considered it.
  * Responsibility is shifted to users with open source.
  * Could add value for home users.
