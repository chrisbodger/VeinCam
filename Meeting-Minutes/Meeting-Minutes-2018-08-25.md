## Agenda

## 1. Project Update
* Histogram function is working, still working on improving.
  * Body fat likely the biggest hurdle.
  * Dark skin worked quite well.
* Still working on getting the stream going (a few lines of code away).
* .stl files are viewable through GitHub (for keeping up to date with chassis prototypes).
* Research:
  * Few other competitors but nothing exactly the same.
  * Definitely a medical device,
    * Further information is needed about manufacturers and where it can be taken.
