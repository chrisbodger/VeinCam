## Agenda
1. Governance/Bureaucratic Issues
   * Medical device classification and manufacturer issues - see documents in Resources file 'Medical Device Classification' and 'Medical device manufacturer'
   * Meeting with ANUSA Lawyer - summary of outcomes in Resources 'Lawyer Meeting Summmary'
     * The safest definition is that we are a manufacturer and it is a medical device
     * Need to re-think the main outputs of the project
     * Human ethics approval needed for testing
   * Emailed Therapeutic Goods Administrations about open source project regulations
   * Emailed a course lecturer about medical devices
   * Correspondence with ANU Human ethics committee - summary in Resources 'Human Ethics Committee Correspondence'
     * Need approval before any testing done
     * Will get the ball rolling on this
   * Meeting with Technology Transfer office Tuesday 18/9 in afternoon
     * Aim to get a second opinion about medical devices, manufacturer definitions and open source projects
     * Get a brief idea of how we could get startup funding
     * Any other advice on how to go forward with getting the device out there in the future
   * Overall changes
     * Not going to make the device open source - not going to provide a how-to tutorial
     * Going to work on restructuring repository and review purpose and main goals of the project
     * Purpose now to product a functional prototype
     * Will still do testing, but only on ourselves and Ben
   * Can use the device for demonstrations, without formal data
   * Client does not want to waste time pursuing commercialisation
2. Hardware/Software Developments
   * Hardware
     * V2.1 of case failed to print several times
       * Required to order new filament
       * Printing will recommence today under full supervision
     * Testing of LEDs will commence
       * Determining an optimal mix of different wavelengths for deeper penetration
       * Final mix will be implemented into the final design
   * Software
     * Decision to discuss: what's first to complete? Manual Control or Image Enhancement
     * Focus will be placed on perfecting selected feature and attempt other as a reach goal.
     * Next primary goal will be to communicate with external LEDs to indicate status of device.
     * Automatic Script Startup and HTML processed image streaming now functional.

3. Feedback
   * Feedback summary now up from Audit 2 - Resources file. Full actions and justifications where necessary - feedback from that?
   * Some things no longer relevant since re-structuring the goals of the project - testing recommendations, etc
   * Starting to look into alternative methods of construction of case
   * Many comments about updating decision log; ensure decisions are well documented
   * Been seeking external opinions about a lot of these regulatory issues - aim to seek other opinions about hardware/software
   * Some comments about the distribution of jobs not being even and the distribution of and the distribution of administrative roles
   * Rotating roles
   * Progress update explicitly state how the project is progressing against each milestone - this is a good idea coming up to the end of the project and with the shift in the project goals
