## Agenda
1. Project Update
2. Alternative chassis manufacturing
3. Web page development

---

## 1. Project Update
* v2.0 being printed at the moment
  * Buttons yet to be added but the form factor has been reduced.
* Still don't quite have the streaming process up and running.
* Current LEDs are 850nm.
* Manual adjustment hasn't been looked into very much at the moment (focus on auto and streaming).
* Battery died in under an hour when streaming the entire desktop (not just an image).
* Could change the filter to address ambient IR light.

## 2. Chassis
* Chris (Browne) has suggested we could try laser cutting a chassis.
* Users will be outsourcing things:
  * Buying the materials
  * Producing the case
  * Producing the circuitboard
* There is an idea that it would be a collaborative effort anyways and that users will be looking for help to construct.
* Leaving the project open for people to adjust components of the device.
* Giving people the case/hardware would cross into manufacturers and create legal issues.
* Might look into having multiple options for the chassis.
* If buying more PLA, white would be preferred.
* Can look at gap filler or sanding to get a smoother chassis surface.

## 3. Web page
* Bios added to give a personal touch to the site.
* Could add a bit more context and history to the site.

---

## Additional Feedback
* Ben's feedback is to keep the software more updated on GitHub.
* In between tests what should Ben be doing with the device.

## Actionables
* Chris to:
  * 
* Steph to:
  * Look into mounting options.
    * Can contact Ben to demonstrate sitautions (e.g. hospital rooms)
* Alex to:
  * 
* Joey to:
  * Develop a project team and bios page for the public site.
* All:
  * Have prototype ready for next saturday to hand over to Ben.
    * In between tests what should Ben be doing with the device (off/on switches/lights etc.)
