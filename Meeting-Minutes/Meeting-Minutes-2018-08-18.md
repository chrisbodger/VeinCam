## Agenda
1. Project Update
   * Startup time
   * Concept sketch
2. Requirements sign-off.
3. ConOps sign-off.

## 1. Project Update
* Issues connecting python with HTML, Alex is looking at solutions.
  * Also working on connecting the different open-source scripts to work together.
* Startup time at the moment is at 20s from cold boot.
  * Issue with using sleep mode is that scripts run on boot up.
  * If we can add in an automatic off-mode (after 5 minutes of inactivity) then might not need to worry about sleep, especially if the boot time is low.
* IR LEDs need to be sourced and wavelengths decided on.
* Chassis concept design is up in the repository.
  * Going to use magnet to connect to a stand.
  * Have clear sections to show LEDs on RasPi indicating on/off and streaming.
* Ben has a domain name (www.veincam.org) that we can point to the GitHub public page.

## 2. Requirements sign-off
* A few benchmarks changed.
* Reprioritised specifications on Requirement 8.

## 3. ConOps sign-off
* Ben is happy with it (verbal confirmation)
* Will draw up a small contract to get electronically signed by stakeholders.
