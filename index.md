## What We're Doing
Our project is part of a final year ANU Engineering course ([ENGN4221](https://eng.anu.edu.au/courses/engn4221/project/)). The main goal of our project is to develop an educational tool for vein visualisation. To do this we're developing the VeinCam to make it easier for educators, students or curious minds to visualise superficial veins.

## How We're Doing It
The VeinCam uses near infrared (nIR) light and a camera to stream a real-time image where veins can be easily seen. It is going to be an open-source, build-it-yourself device so anyone who finds it useful will be able to construct it. We'll provide a how-to guide of what materials to buy, how to put them together and the software to upload to get it all working.

## When We're Done
This page will provide all the necessary downloads, links and resources that you'll need to construct a VeinCam yourself.

## Where We're At Now
We are now at the end of our turn with the project, and we have completed all we have set out to do. We have the automatic image adjustment to create a high contrast image of veins, and have some manual adjustment controls all embedded within the same preview web page.

Our final protoype is complete, and looks absolutely stunning along side our favourite houseplant, Hugh!
