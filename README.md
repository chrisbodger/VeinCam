## 1. Feedback
A feedback form has been created for the interest of our stakeholders, should they wish to pass on any changes or improvements they believe to be prudent. The form can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/8cw5eWdaOY5C1jBo1).

Once we receive the feedback, we will create an issue within the GitHub repository for public viewing and tracking. Any feedback is welcome.

## 2. Progress Update
**August 11th**

Audit 1 has come and gone, and we thought it to be quite successful! We have recieved your feedback and have begun actioning it. To address a few points that were raised that can be addressed immediately:

**Version Control and Task Tracking** - This Github repository has an issue tracking ability. this is generally used by coders to track bugs and issues raised by users and the team, where both parties can communicate on the progress and resolutions. We are utilising in a way that tracks our actionables, and reminds us what is outstanding so they dont get lost in the project. once a task is complete, we close the issue, and it can be found under the **Closed** tab.

**Informal Language** - Several feedback responses came back with the informal language used in formal documents such as the meeting minutes. We understand that this may look careless in regards to the direction of this project, and we will endevour to minimise the use of this language going forward.

**Team Roles** -  To provide clarity on the teams dynamic, we agreed from the onset that the team would work with each other to compete each and every aspect of the projects development. the "Roles" shown in our ConOps is more of a formality - titles given to each of us in more of a lead role, but not a dedicated one.

On that note, please view the current outstanding issues, new ones have been created to action major points raised by your feedback during the Audit 1 period. The documents requested in the feedback are in the process of being drafted, and hopefully see the light of day soon!

We would like to thank everyone who provided feedback, each little bit will prove to be useful and valuable to the success of this project.

### Project Update
To address 2 birds with one stone, we will endouvour to keep this section updated more often, hopefully after each meeting, as requested from the feedback. Unfortunately, not much progress was made during the week, as team members were predesposed with other tasks across other subjects.

#### Hardware/Software
Several attempts were made to get the HackADay software to run on the Raspberry Pi. Unfortunately, despite being configured appropriately, a connection to an external device could not be made. This meant that the first milestone could not be truly completed, as the HackADay concept could not be fully realised. The team put this down to changes in hardware and software versions in the last ~12 months, as well as the rushed nature of the Venenfinder code development. 

The decision was made to continue forward with the project and consider Milestone 1 complete. Enough information was learned during testing, and enough resources were collected to start developing more robust software for VeinCam. Already, a network stream has been established using new code.

## 3. Audit Log
Here we will have the information, results, and feedback to our audits, and will be presented in the following links (as they are created):

* Audit 1
* Audit 2
* Audit 3

Should our stakeholders wish to provide us with feedback, they can fill out a google survey in which we will action them appropriately as responses are presented to us.

## 4. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations is still being drafted, and yet to be signed off. we hope to have this completed by the end of the audit period, in which we can continue with the project.

The [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

## 5. Meeting Minutes
Team meetings are scheduled twice a week, to ensure the team is aware of the overall progress made, as well to provide the client an opportunity to see what we have achieved, should they choose to join the meetings. They are currently scheduled for the following times:
* Wednesday 11pm
* Saturday 2pm

The Saturday Meeting is primarily made available for meeting with the client, and to provide a weekly update, where Wednesday is an internal midweek meeting to ensure our actionables are on track for completion. These times may vary, depending on the availability of the team, and client. 

Meeting Minutes can also be found in our repository:

## 6. Design Documents
The design of the VeinCam will be presented here, once the ConOps has been approved, and progress/final designs are made available. the construction method of the device will also be presented here.
