## 1. Progress Update
Currently, we are preparing for Audit 1 by creating the project documentation. This includes:
* Project requirements
* [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md)
* Stakeholder Landing Page
* [Work Breakdown Structure](docs/WBS.md) and [Indicative Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfNqFCF2ieP5CyVmqDSeZ3oXegxcCG4hojdd6fMcq9Y/edit?usp=sharing) 
* Basic Structure of the Repository (this will evolve as the project proceeds)

We hope to have this all ready to present to our stakeholders during our tutorial, otherwise have it completed by the end of the audit period.

#### Previous Progress Updates
* Not applicable yet

## 2. Audit Log
Here we will have the information, results, and feedback to our audits, and will be presented in the following links (as they are created):

* Audit 1
* Audit 2
* Audit 3

Should our stakeholders wish to provide us with feedback, they can fill out a google survey in which we will action them appropriately as responses are presented to us.

## 3. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations is still being drafted, and yet to be signed off. we hope to have this completed by the end of the audit period, in which we can continue with the project.

The [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

## 4. Meeting Minutes
Team meetings are scheduled twice a week, to ensure the team is aware of the overall progress made, as well to provide the client an opportunity to see what we have achieved, should they choose to join the meetings. They are currently scheduled for the following times:
* Wednesday 12pm
* Saturday 2pm

These times may vary, depending on the availability of the team, and client.

Meeting Minutes can also be found in our repository:
