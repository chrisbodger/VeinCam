# 1. Feedback
A feedback form has been created for the interest of our stakeholders, should they wish to pass on any changes or improvements they believe to be prudent. The form can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/8cw5eWdaOY5C1jBo1).

Once the feedback has been received, an issue will be created within the GitHub repository for public viewing and tracking.  
**Any feedback is welcome.**

# 2. Progress Update
## September 5th
Progress this week has been based around finalising the prototype. This has taken longer than anticipated due to a few setbacks with 3D printing and finalising code.

### Hardware
Version 2.0 of the chassis has proved difficult to complete as there has been complications with the 3D printers. A version was printed however the mounting pins inside the case were malformed. An ad hoc mechanism may be used with the print and if the issue persists then an alternative will be chosen. Version 2.1 will be printed tomorrow with the hope that it will be suitable to hand to the client for preliminary testing.

### Software
A successful stream has been created with the automatic contrast adjustment. The next step is to get the Pi to run the necessary scripts on boot so that the process can be simple and automated when users turn on the device. 

The goal is to complete a working prototype in both hardware and software to give to the client this Saturday (8th of September)

# 3. Audit Log
Here we will have the information, results, and feedback to our audits, and will be presented in the following links (as they are created):

* Audit 1
* Audit 2
* Audit 3

Should our stakeholders wish to provide us with feedback, they can fill out a google survey in which we will action them appropriately as responses are presented to us.

# 4. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations is nearly complete. after we have completed the feedback from Audit 1, we feel that this document will be ready for sign off.

The [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

# 5. Meeting Minutes
Team meetings are scheduled twice a week, to ensure the team is aware of the overall progress made, as well to provide the client an opportunity to see what we have achieved, should they choose to join the meetings. They are currently scheduled for the following times:
* Wednesday 11pm
* Saturday 2pm

The Saturday Meeting is primarily made available for meeting with the client, and to provide a weekly update, where Wednesday is an internal midweek meeting to ensure our actionables are on track for completion. These times may vary, depending on the availability of the team, and client.

Meeting Minutes can also be found in our repository:
