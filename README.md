## 1. Feedback
A feedback form has been created for the interest of our stakeholders, should they wish to pass on any changes or improvements they believe to be prudent. The form can be found [here](https://goo.gl/forms/8cw5eWdaOY5C1jBo1).

Once we receive the feedback, we will create an issue within the GitHub repository for public viewing and tracking. Any feedback is welcome.

## 2. Progress Update
August 7th
After a successful [meeting](#Meeting-Minutes/Meeting-Minutes-2018-08-04.md) with the client, we are confident that we have a clear direction on how the project will proceed. The client agreed that our initial [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) was sensible and mutually agreed that the milestones set out within the document are achievable. The missing fields within the ConOps will need to be filled in this week, as per our goals set out within the [August 1st](Meeting-Minutes/Meeting-Minutes-2018-08-01.md) team meeting.

#### Hardware Update
The supplied hardware has been prepared with an operating system and prerequisite software, opening the way for further testing in regards to the HackADay software. Commencement of this task will be this week in efforts to achieve our first milestone.

While a definitive contrast for vein detection may not be possible without some manual hardware that will not be used (The potentiometers from the Venenfinder), we hope that something may be detected using what we currently have. This will save an unnecessary expense as these components are planned to be replaced by automatic tuning algorithms.

## 3. Audit Log
Here we will have the information, results, and feedback to our audits, and will be presented in the following links (as they are created):

* Audit 1
* Audit 2
* Audit 3

Should our stakeholders wish to provide us with feedback, they can fill out a google survey in which we will action them appropriately as responses are presented to us.

## 4. Concept of Operations
Our Concept of Operations is still being drafted, and yet to be signed off. we hope to have this completed by the end of the audit period, in which we can continue with the project.

The [Concept of Operations](docs/CONOPS.md) document can be found in our repository.

## 5. Meeting Minutes
Team meetings are scheduled twice a week, to ensure the team is aware of the overall progress made, as well to provide the client an opportunity to see what we have achieved, should they choose to join the meetings. They are currently scheduled for the following times:
* Wednesday 12pm
* Saturday 2pm

These times may vary, depending on the availability of the team, and client.

Meeting Minutes can also be found in our repository:
